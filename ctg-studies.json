This single-arm pilot study will be used as a go vs. no-go decision on performing a randomized-controlled trial.\n\nThe study's primary effectiveness objective is to demonstrate that the patient's functionality (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores) has improved from baseline at one month. The study's primary safety objective is to demonstrate that serious device/procedure related adverse events and subsequent surgical interventions are no greater than those in a literature control of other percutaneous disc decompression procedures at discharge, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment.\n\nSecondary objectives are to demonstrate procedural success and improvement in the pain and function of the subjects at 1, 6, and 12 months using the VAS and ODI scales as well as tracking analgesic medication use. Pain and function scores for each follow-up time will be compared to the baseline scores.","detailedDescription":"The AO-1000 device provides an oxygen-ozone treatment for contained herniated discs. An oxygen-ozone treatment is a minimally invasive injection for treating disc herniations that is widely practiced in Europe and Asia. This treatment involves the injection of an oxygen-ozone mixture into the herniated disc and/or the paravertebral muscle surrounding the disc. However, there are no medical ozone generators for this procedure that are currently cleared by the FDA for use in the US. Many studies using a wide range of inclusion/exclusion criteria, ozone concentrations, and procedures have been performed to determine the effectiveness of oxygen-ozone treatment.\n\nA meta-analysis of nearly 8,000 patients from published studies shows a mean improvement of 39 mm for VAS and 25.7 for ODI. The likelihood of complications was 0.064%. Furthermore, no cases of discitis were reported after oxygen-ozone therapy, which is unlike all the other methods of disc volume reduction. This is most likely due to the fact that ozone is a strong oxidizer and an excellent disinfecting agent. The complications shown in the meta-analysis were minor and transient, and easily avoidable by utilizing a device such as the AO-1000 that is designed to eliminate these types of complications (ozone leakage into the treatment room and high ozone concentrations) during this procedure. The estimated complication rate from the meta-analysis is consistent with the Italian Oxygen-Ozone Therapy Federation (FIO) results (no procedure-related adverse events in treatments on 15,000 patients).\n\nThe safety of the direct injection of oxygen-ozone gas mixture into the nucleus pulposus was well established in these studies. Therefore, the intent of this study is to obtain data to confirm that a 2 weight percent (wt%) oxygen-ozone mixture delivered from the AO-1000 device is safe and effective for the intended use. This clinical study is designed to bridge the AO-1000 to the extensive prior oxygen-ozone treatment safety and effectiveness data between studies such as those found in the Meta-analysis that did not use the AO-1000 as the delivery system."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disk, Herniated"],"keywords":["Ozone","Oxygen","Oxygen-Ozone","AO-1000","ActiveO","Herniated Disc","Disc","Lumbar"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":39,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AO-1000 Treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Oxygen-ozone treatment with the AO-1000 device","interventionNames":["Device: AO-1000"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"AO-1000","description":"Mixture of 2 weight% ozone in 98 weight% oxygen injected into the nucleus pulposus of a contained herniated disc.","armGroupLabels":["AO-1000 Treatment"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: Change from Baseline ODI Score at 1 Month","description":"Mean change from baseline ODI score, analyzed at 1 month.

Involving patients in the decisions whether or not to have surgery is therefore essential. A small survey performed at our Spine Center however, showed that patients were often not fully involved in this treatment decision. Not being involved might lead patients to decision regret and unnecessary conflicts in the decision-making process. The purpose of this project is therefore to assess the effect of a newly developed patient decision aid (PtDA) to facilitate shared decision making (SDM), when patients choose between surgical or non-surgical treatment for LDH, on SDM, decisional conflict, decision regret and treatment outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. The project is performed at Center of Spine Surgery \\& Research, Middelfart. Inclusion and one month follow up is already completed and one year follow-up data currently being collected.","detailedDescription":"Purpose of the project\n\nThe overall purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a generic PtDA-template adapted to patients choosing between surgical and non-surgical treatment for LDH, on SDM, decisional conflict, decision regret and treatment outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Development of an effective PtDA has the potential to decrease patients' decision regret and optimize treatment results and thereby in the future lead to higher patient satisfaction and fewer patient complaints. Using a generic PtDA-template, makes it feasible to adapt the used method to other spine-departments or other orthopedic-surgeries.\n\nBackground\n\nShared decision making (SDM) is a systematic approach aimed at improving patient involvement in preference-sensitive health care decisions. It is a process, wherein clinicians actively involve patients during the task of making decisions , based on best clinical evidence and patients' informed preferences.\n\nMost people with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) improve with nonsurgical treatment. However, in Denmark, patients with ongoing severe pain and disability after 12 weeks of conservative care are recommended a surgical evaluation. Apart from the presence of a neurologic deficit, there are no clearly defined indications for surgery. A variety of factors, such as level of pain, walking capacity or functional limitations, can influence the judgment of the physician to advocate surgery or not. Indications for surgery are thus assessed, for each particular patient, by the individual surgeon. Even though surgical patients show a more rapid relief of pain and recovery, the evidence of surgery being superior to conservative treatment in the long term is nevertheless inconclusive. This underlines the concept that the choice of having surgical or non-surgical treatment for LHD is preference sensitive, meaning that treatment options should be offered and should matter to patients. A qualitative study by Andersen showed that the current lack of evidence for a superior treatment choice and the presence of uncertainties in risks and benefits are important to discuss with patients with LDH. Currently, there are no standard procedures used to actively involve patients in such decisions. SDM is required to accomplish the preference sensitive approach for patients with LDH.\n\nPatient decision aids (PtDA) are tools designed to facilitate SDM, and are intended to complement counseling with health professionals. Such a tool could help patients become involved in decision making by making explicit the decision that needs to be made, providing information about the advantages and disadvantages of treatment options (or tests), knowledge of treatment outcomes, and by clarifying personal values. Decision Aids compared to usual care seems to improve decision quality and patient knowledge regarding options and reduce their decisional conflict. Some studies also show that PtDAs enable patients to be more actively involved in decision making, and improve the accuracy of risk perceptions when probabilities are included A few English tools have already been designed for patients with LDH. However, these tools were designed to prepare the patients, prior to consultation with a physician and not, as intended in this project, to be used in the clinical encounter. Therefore, prior to this study a PtDAs have been designed and tested for use in spine surgery in a Danish context.\n\nStudy 1 - Does the use of a decision aid in a spine surgery clinic facilitate SDM?\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Objectives are to determine whether the use of a DA is superior to standard consultation, in terms of:\n\n1. Involving and informing the patients in the decision of treatment.\n2. Minimizing uncertainty, and other conflicting factors, when choosing treatment for herniated disc.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign The study will be performed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Ten surgeons will be allocated to either using or not using a DA in the surgery clinic, in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIntervention The intervention is the use of a PtDA for LDH, in a routine doctor-patient consultation, by a trained spine surgeon. All surgeons randomized to use the PtDA will go through a training session held by educators in communication, who is specialized in SDM.\n\nStudy population Study subjects will be recruited from Center for Spine Surgery and Research, Lillebaelt Hospital, Middelfart, amongst patients being a candidate for primary discectomy for a LDH from L1-S1.\n\nData will be collected post consultation in both arms, as the patients exit the consultation.\n\nStatistics (see study 2)\n\nStudy 2 - Does the use of a decision aid in a spine surgery clinic improve outcomes?\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives are to determine if there is a correlation between the use of a DA in the consultation and:\n\n1. Better recovery after treatment, measured by leg pain (VAS leg), back pain (VAS back), ODI and EQ5D, one month and one year after spine surgery.\n2. The level of decisional regret one month and one year after chosen treatment.\n\nMethods\n\nDesign, intervention and study-population will be the same as in study 2. However, if patients end up with other surgery than discectomy they will be excluded from the study.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAs the DQW-HD, DCS, ODI, EQ-5D and VAS Leg and Back pain scores are long ordinal scales, differences in scores, between the groups will be tested using nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for independent samples. Sample size rationale was powered from the main outcome variable in study 3 VAS-leg. Allowing for 30% dropout before completing the study, we need to enroll 70 patients in each arm. All Statistical analyses will be performed using Stata v. 14.0.\n\nResearch plan The inclusion started in May 2017. All the patients in the RCT are included and one month follow-up data are collected. Collection of one year follow-up data will has also begun.\n\nPractical framework\n\nAll Spine surgeons at the surgery department accepted to participate in the study. Patients were recruited by these surgeons. The research department assists with data-collection at one month and one year follow-up.\n\nPublication and dissemination of results\n\nResults will be published in national and international peer-reviewed journals (i.e. The Spine, The Patient - Patient-Centered Outcomes Research) and presented at national and international conferences (i.e. Dansk Ortopædkirurgisk Selskabs årsmøde (DOS), International Shared Decision Making conference (ISDM), International Conference on Communication in Health Care (ICCH).\n\nEthical aspects\n\nThe study will be conducted according to Danish ethical principles, and notified at the Danish Data Protection Agency. Participants will be given written information about the purpose of the study and will sign an informed consent before the first questionnaires are completed. Surgeons give oral consent. Apart from the use of a PtDA in the consultation, all patients in the study receive \"usual care\". No changes are made in relation to which clinicians the patients meet or offered treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Herniated Disk"],"keywords":["Shared Decision Making, Lumbar Herniated Disk"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":142,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Use of a Patient Decision Aid","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"A Patient Decision Aid is used in this arm in the clinical encounter.

This syndrome affects about 1-2% of the population, usually at the age of 30 to 50 (the prime working years) leading to significant economic impact.\n\nInjuries of nerves can lead to degeneration of the parent nerve cells, the neurons. Recent evidence indicates that herniated lumbar disc exerts mechanical pressure on spinal nerve roots that leads to local ischemia and inflammation resulting in nerve injury (i.e. neurotrauma). This neurotrauma can lead to degeneration of the corresponding nerve cells (dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and spinal cord motoneurons), resulting in persistent deficits in motor functions, sensation and pain. Enhancing nerve cell survival capabilities (i.e., neuroprotection), therefore, should prove a novel therapeutic strategy for slowing or preventing degeneration of neurons resulting from herniated lumbar disc compression. Yet, in spite of an intensive search, clinically effective and safe neuroprotective therapeutic is not available.\n\nThe active ingredient in the dietary/medical food supplement under study was discovered to be an efficacious neuroprotective agent. The original findings, confirmed by laboratories throughout the world, indicate that the active compound is unique as it acts at multiple molecular targets to exert its robust neuropeotective effects.\n\nThe active ingredient is found in many plant, fish and meet foodstuffs and is being used and sold as a food supplement and nutraceutical. Its use as a neuroprotective agent is patented and thus, it constitutes an ideal candidate for neuroprotective treatment in herniated lumbar disc and other spine skeletal pathologies causing nerve compression.\n\nThe safety of the dietary supplement under study was clearly demonstrated in a recent clinical trial. Results of the trial demonstrated improvement in the general health status and indicated efficacy in alleviating symptoms in participants with herniated lumbar disc and other spine skeletal pathologies causing nerve root compression.\n\nThe present study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to ascertain the therapeutic efficacy of the dietary supplement in participants with herniated lumbar disc causing nerve damage symptoms. The study is being conducted in two medical centers in Israel. Eighty participants are presently being recruited and are screened under strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible individuals are invited to participate after signing a detailed informed consent prior to beginning of the study. The participants are being assigned randomly to receive either the dietary ingredient or placebo in a blind fashion whereby neither the treating physician nor the participant are aware of the type of treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Herniated Disc"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":79,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Dietary supplement GVG 2"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Dietary supplement GVG 2","description":"2.670 g/day for 14 days","armGroupLabels":["A"],"otherNames":["GAVMATINE(TM)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Measurements of herniated lumbar disc-related symptoms including sensorimotor neurological functions and pain sensations.

The Student t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, median, frequency, ratio, minimum, maximum) in two groups, as well as the normal distribution of quantitative data. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used in the comparison of three groups with no normal distribution. The Pearson Chi-square test was used to evaluate qualitative data, and Spearman's correlation analysis was used to evaluate intervariable relationships. The Friedman and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used in the evaluation of three or more follow-up parameters without normal distribution. Diagnostic screening tests (sensitivity, specificity) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to determine the cutoff value for age.

Throughout, many techniques have been described. Studies indicate that the treatment was successful for pain and disability resulting from herniated disc associated with radiculopathy small.\n\nHowever, some methods remove very small amounts of tissue with little change in volume of the disc. Thus, studies on the cadaver with Percutaneous Diskectomy by SpineJet ® showed more macroscopic changes of the disc with a predictable amount of removal and significant disc material.\n\nThe Percutaneous Diskectomy by SpineJet ® is a new technique of percutaneous diskectomy which creates a suction effect in tissues adjacent to the exit point of the fluid and the opening point of the collector. However, no studies have examined the effect of the Percutaneous Diskectomy by SpineJet ® in humans about the disk size after treatment or measures of disc degeneration by imaging methods or how these characteristics might correlate with clinical outcomes.\n\nThus, the study will compare outcomes of patients with contained or extruded disc herniation, with complaints of radiculopathy, concordant with the imaging findings. With treatment by surgical technique or the traditional by SpineJet ®, in order to determine whether percutaneous discectomy with SpineJet ® will produce results comparable to open microdiskectomy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Radiculopathy","Herniated Disk"],"keywords":["spine surgery","low back pain","herniated disk"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":40,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"OMicro","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"This group will be formed by randomization, which gets out surgery to open microdiscectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Open microdiscectomy"]},{"label":"SJet","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This group will be formed by randomization, and receive the discectomy procedure addressed by the technique of Percutaneous Diskectomy SpineJet","interventionNames":["Procedure: Percutaneous Diskectomy SpineJet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Open microdiscectomy","description":"The open microdiscectomy, will be performed under general anesthesia in the prone position with horizontal.

Background Lumbar spine surgery can be performed using different anaesthetic techniques such as general endotracheal anaesthesia (GA) or spinal-based regional anaesthesia (RA). In a recent review several studies showed a decreased postoperative pain score in the RA groups (1). But only few randomized control trials (RCT) have been performed comparing these two anaesthetic techniques and have shown partly conflicting results (2-5).\n\n   Each anaesthetic agent or regimen has a particular side effect profile (e.g. opioids - nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation; local anaesthetics - motor weakness) which may affect quality of recovery in different ways. Although there are few data examining the correlation between side effects from different analgesic regimens and quality of recovery per se, some data suggest different analgesic regimens will result in different side effects and consequently different levels of quality of recovery.\n\n   Although inconsistent data exist covering surgery time, anaesthesia time, postoperative anaesthetic care unit (PACU) time and postoperative analgesic dose requirements (6-8).\n\n   But there are some hinds that RA leads to better results concerning postoperative mortality and morbidity in opposite to general anaesthesia (9-10). Also RA showed better results concerning economic aspects (11,12).\n\n   No clinical trials have sufficient subject numbers to determine definitively the effects of anaesthetic techniques on minor or major benefits concerning clinical outcome. There is insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the ability of these two anaesthetic techniques to affect major postoperative mortality or morbidity and there is currently no sufficient evidence that RA or GA have any clinically significant beneficial effect on postoperative outcome. Further there are still insufficient data to determine if the type of anaesthetic technique, degree of analgesia and the presence of side effects may influence quality of life, quality of recovery, patient and surgeon's satisfaction and length of hospitalisation.\n\n   There are few data examining the correlation between side effects from different anaesthetic regimens and quality of recovery per se, some data suggest different analgesic regimens may result in different side effects and consequently different levels of quality of recovery.\n\n   Although there are data suggesting that improved postoperative analgesia leads to better patient outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to support subsequent improvements inpatient-centered outcomes such as quality of life and quality of recovery. So the correlation between RA and different outcome parameters are very complex and up to now there is no clear evidence for any recommendation concerning the use of RA or GA in generally (13).\n2. Study Objective Lumbar spine surgery can be performed using different anaesthetic techniques such as general endotracheal anaesthesia (GA) or spinal-based regional anaesthesia (RA). The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of two different anaesthetic techniques and their impact on clinical outcome.\n\n   Further this study is developed to combine validated patient-reported instruments with the assessment of the effect of different anaesthetic techniques on patient-reported outcomes in the peri-and postoperative period.\n3. Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery, the performing of a RA shows significant benefits in comparison with patients receiving GA. It concerns the postoperative pain score, the degree of PONV, the PACU and anaesthesia time and the patient's and surgeons's satisfaction."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Herniated Disk Lumbar"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","maskingDescription":"Outcomes Assessor and statistician are blinded.","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"General Anaesthesia","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"General Anaesthesia during surgery","interventionNames":["Procedure: General anaesthesia"]},{"label":"Regional Anaesthesia","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Regional Anaesthesia during surgery","interventionNames":["Procedure: Regional anaesthesia"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"General anaesthesia","description":"General anaesthesia","armGroupLabels":["General Anaesthesia"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Regional anaesthesia","description":"Regional anaesthesia","armGroupLabels":["Regional Anaesthesia"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Morphine consumption","description":"Cumulated morphine consumption in mg","timeFrame":"From immediately after the operation until 48 hours postoperative"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"VAS score","description":"Visual Analog Pain assessment, assessed each day","timeFrame":"Postoperative at the day of surgery until 48 hours postoperative"},{"measure":"Anesthesia time","description":"Duration of anesthesia in minutes","timeFrame":"Day of surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient must give informed consent before registration.\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Physical Status Classification of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists Score (ASA) ≤ 3\n* Patient with a diagnosed lumbar spinal stenosis or a herniated lumbar disc for elective neurosurgery\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* ASA ≥ 4\n* Infection at the site of the operation field\n* Longterm History (≥ 6 month) of neuropathic pain on the operation site\n* Revision surgery and/or follow-up operations\n* Severe coagulopathy (platelet count \\< 100.000 / mL3 or Thromboplastin time \\< 50%)\n* Allergy to local anaesthetics or opioids\n* Previous drug dependency or chronic use of opioids (≥ 6 month)\n* Psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information on trial related topics or given informant consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Bertram Bänziger, MD","affiliation":"Klinik St. Anna Luzern","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"St. Anna Hospital","city":"Luzern","zip":"CH - 6006","country":"Switzerland","geoPoint":{"lat":47.05048,"lon":8.30635}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"24635923","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"De Rojas JO, Syre P, Welch WC.

Differences in effectiveness will be determined using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) calculated from the EQ-5D and the SF-6D. Both these health state utility values will be used, as studies in low back patients have shown a marked difference in the calculation of QALYs when one or the other is used (9-11).\n\nHo: There is a difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the EuroQOL-5D at 12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.\n\nH1: There is no difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the EuroQOL-5D at 12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.\n\nHo: There is a difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the SF-6D (transformed from the SF-36) (12) at 12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.\n\nH1: There is no difference in gain in health state utility, as measured by the SF-6D (transformed from the SF-36)(12) at 12 months post-operative compared to baseline, between patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.\n\nIn order to calculate costs, both direct (cost of rehabilitation) and indirect costs (lost wages) need to be determined.\n\nHo: There is a difference in number of days between surgery and return to work, between patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.\n\nH1: There is no difference in number of days between surgery and return to work, between patients undergoing supervised physical rehabilitation in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation compared to unsupervised home exercises.\n\nMethods:\n\nDesign:\n\nRandomized clinical trial, 1:1 parallel group, non-inferiority, single blinded trial comparing (Arm1) supervised physical rehabilitation (SPT) in patients after surgery for lumbar disc herniation to (Arm 2) unsupervised home exercises (UHE). Performed in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines (13).\n\nA computer generated randomization random variable block of 4-6 at 1:1 allocation will be created by a researcher that will not be involved in recruitment, screening or identification of potential subjects (LYC). The assigned treatment arm will be kept in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be opened after the informed consent process is complete. The randomization envelope and sheet will be kept with the subject's research record.\n\nStratification factors, such as age, gender, race and approach (microdiscectomy versus open) are not included for balancing the randomization but will be included in the analyses. Since the primary outcome measure is a difference within same subject (subject is their own control), some variability due to these factors will be reduced. In additional, due to block randomization and assuming random patient arrival (such as not all patients scheduled for microdiscectomy will be coming to clinic in the beginning of the study and then followed by patients scheduled for open discectomy), there will be enough representation based on these factors. In addition, at the Center for Spine Surgery microdiscectomy can denote the use of a microscope during an open discectomy or the use of tubular, limited dissection without a microscope.\n\nStudy population:\n\nStudy subjects will be recruited from patients assessed and scheduled for primary discectomy for a lumbar disc herniation from L1 to S1 at the Center for Spine Surgery and Research, Sygehus Lillebælt.\n\nPatient course:\n\nDuring the initial consultation at Sector for Spine Surgery and Research, Middelfart, study subjects will undergo a neurological exam including range of motion, sensibility, reflexes and strength in the lower extremities and back. Patients are also asked to complete multiple questionnaires (basic personal information, occupational status, DaneSpine questionnaire, ODI, SF-36, and EQ-5D) as mentioned in section 5.1 Data collection. These procedures are all standard of care.\n\nPatients identified by the attending surgeon as eligible for inclusion are invited to participate in the study by the Principal Investigator (RTP). Patients who express an interest in participating will be given written and oral information on the background, purpose and method of the study. Information and inclusion of participants will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of The Health Research Ethics Committee System in Denmark, from which approval will be sought.\n\nBefore surgery when a subject has been screened and included in the study, and the informed consent process is completed and the informed consent document is signed, the randomization envelope will be opened. The subject will be randomize to either the supervised physical therapy or the unsupervised home exercise arm using a variable blocks of 4-6 with 1:1 allocation.\n\nThe supervised physical therapy group will be rehabilitated 4 weeks postoperative at the municipality rehabilitation unit with training sessions 2 times a week in 8 weeks. The home exercise group will be discharged with an informational booklet and advice to begin normal daily activities as soon as possible. All patients will be asked to keep a diary of contact to external health care professionals, amount of trainings and painkillers.\n\nAll patients participating in the study will undergo standard operative treatment, either open or microscopically, at Center for Spine Surgery and Research, Middelfart, and scheduled for an outpatient clinical visits at 1 and 3 months post-operative. Control at 1 month is conducted by a physiotherapist and as part of standard care. All patients must keep a diary of trainings, external medical- and physiotherapist\n\nStatistics:\n\nThe primary analysis will be an intent-to-treat analysis with the change in ODI scores between six months and baseline as the primary outcome measures. Repeated measures ANOVA with the baseline ODI score as a covariate will be used to compare the two arms. In addition Fisher's exact test will be used to determine differences in categorical variables will between groups.\n\nSample size rationale:\n\nPatients will be randomized in two groups, supervised physical therapy (SPT) and unsupervised home exercises (UHE). The main outcome variable is the Oswestry Disability Index, which is a disease specific outcome measure, and will be used for sample size justification. Based on the published literature, the baseline ODI for patients with disc herniation is 48 points with a standard deviation of 19 units (15)This is similar to the data from N2QOD. Change in ODI score from the baseline to one year was 24 points (95% CI: 21-27) with estimated standard deviation of 16 points.\n\nUsing two-sided, two-sample independent t-test, we can detect a mean difference of 0.50 SD units at alpha=5% and power=80 with n1=64 and n2=64. This translates into the effect size of 10 points. Since final follow-up is at one year an interim analysis is not planned. We plan to randomize subjects in 1:1 ratio in supervised physical therapy and unsupervised home exercise arms in randomized block sizes of 4 and 6. Stratification factors, such as age, gender and race are not included for balancing the randomization but will be included in the analyses. As the primary outcome measure is a difference within same subject (subject is their own control), some variability due to these factors may be reduced. In addition, due to block randomization and assuming random patient arrival, there will be enough demographic representation based on these factors. We will increase sample size by 15% to account for drop out or death before the completion of the study. Thus we need to enroll 74 subjects in each arm. Using the method of Diggle et al. for sample size calculation in longitudinal studies and assuming a positive correlation around 0.4, we will have at least 85% to detect the same effect size.\n\nQuality control and quality assurance:\n\nThe study will be registered at the Ethical Committee of Southern Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency.\n\nAll patient data, including information on private matters or other confidential information, will be strictly confidential and stored according to the Danish Open Administration Act, the Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data and the Health Act.\n\nThe study will be performed in accordance with the guidelines recommended by STROBE (STrenghtening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disk Herniated Lumbar","Physiotherapy","Surgery"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":146,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard municipal rehabilitation","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"Standard care with postoperative rehabilitation at the municipal facility."},{"label":"No referral for rehabilitation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"No referral for supervised postoperative rehabilitation.

The effect of this sagittal profile especially type 2 with almost straight lordosis on the clinical outcomes of patients after mini-open discectomy is unknown. In this study, the results of patients who underwent mini-open discectomy were evaluated according to sagittal profile types of the patients.","detailedDescription":"Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is the most common cause of sciatica and when conservative treatment fails or there is progressive neurological deficit, surgical excision of the herniated nucleosus pulposus is standard of care. Although minimally invasive methods such as endoscopic discectomy have been tried to be popular in recent years, open lumbar discectomy is still successfully performed in lumbar disc herniations due to some drawbacks of endoscopic techniques such as having long learning curve, higher radiation exposure to the surgeon, similar long-term results or the deception of commercial enterprises about endoscopic techniques and the pressure placed on surgeons in this direction.\n\nHerniation of the nucleus pulposus as a result of massive LDH will inevitably result in disruption of normal lumbar biomechanics. Moreover, it has been shown that the healing process of the posterolateral herniation, which is biologically the weakest part of the posterior longitudinal ligament, will cause disc degeneration as a result of the repair and inflammation process in the annulus. However, the same authors claimed that, unlike the process in discogenic low back pain, macrophages in herniated discs can act to remove free pulposus fragments. There are few studies in the literature about the long-term consequences of this degeneration, which the investigators can consider as an accelerated aging process. Although clinically very successful results are obtained in the early postoperative period, it has been reported that the long-term success after discectomy may decrease from 90% to 60% over time. Depression or somatization, strenuous job and recurrent disc herniation or degeneration have been shown to cause long-term regression of results. In a prospective cohort study the authors reported a similar or worse leg pain rate in 30% of patients at the end of 10 years. In a study investigating reoperation after open lumbar discectomy, it was reported that the estimated rate of reoperation reached almost 45% at the end of 30 years.\n\nIn an extraordinary review evaluating the spinopelvic organization and the pathological adaptation to it, the mechanical stress, especially increased by hypolordosis, would cause the degenerative process in the spine to progress more rapidly. The basic theories explaining this are that the contact force, which is defined as the resultant force of the system created by gravity and abdominal pressure from the front and the dense paraspinal muscle mass from the posterior, mainly targets the discs. However, studies evaluating spinopelvic orientation in patients with LDH are limited. In a case-control study investigating the relationship between sciatica and spinopelvic harmony, more vertical sacrum, anterior C7 plumb line and hypolordosis were found in the LDH group. In a study examining the etiology and mechanism of sagittal imbalance caused by LDH, lumbar lordosis improved almost twice after endoscopic discectomy and LDH is probably one of the causes of compensatory sagittal imbalance.\n\nAlthough there are studies on the pathogenesis and mechanics of LDH's etiology and post-discectomy results, the effect of the generally accepted normal lordosis types described by Roussouly P. on the degenerative process and patient scores after open standard discectomy is unknown. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to compare the clinical results of patients with hypolordotic Type 2 and other types after open discectomy. Our hypothesis is that the mid-term clinical scores will be worse in Roussouly Type 2 patients with less lordosis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Displacement of Intervertebral Disc Without Myelopathy"],"keywords":["intervertebral disc displacement, spinal curvatures, Outcome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Type 2","description":"Patients with Roussouly type 2 sagittal profile","interventionNames":["Procedure: lumbar discectomy"]},{"label":"Type 1,3,4","description":"Patients with other Roussouly type sagittal profiles (1,3,4)","interventionNames":["Procedure: lumbar discectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"lumbar discectomy","description":"mini-open discectomy","armGroupLabels":["Type 1,3,4","Type 2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)","description":"quantify disability for low back pain","timeFrame":"change between preoperative and postoperative last (12th month) control"},{"measure":"Japanese Orthopedic Association scores","description":"a simple scoring measure for radiculopathy with 29 points: Excellent neurological function 25-28 points: Good neurological function 17-24 points: Fair neurological function 11-16 points: Poor neurological function 10 points and below: Bad neurological function","timeFrame":"at 12th month control"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Body mass index (kg/cm2)","description":"demographic characteristic","timeFrame":"preoperative"},{"measure":"abdominal diameter","description":"radiological assessment of coronal abdominal diameter, cm","timeFrame":"preoperative"},{"measure":"classification of disc degeneration","description":"Pfirrmann grading scale for intervertebral disc degeneration where Grade I: Normal disc appearance with high signal intensity, a smooth contour, and high water content.\n\nGrade II: Mild signs of degeneration with slightly decreased high signal intensity compared to normal discs.\n\nGrade III: Moderate degeneration with an irregular contour, further decreased high signal intensity, and possible small fissures within the disc.\n\nGrade IV: Severe degeneration with a more pronounced irregularity, significant decrease in high signal intensity, and presence of larger fissures and herniations within the disc.\n\nGrade V: Advanced degeneration with a substantially decreased signal intensity, loss of contour, and structural integrity of the disc.

Among various expansion in surgical procedures; minimally invasive surgery of spine has gaining more advantage for spinal decompression, spinal fusion and instrumentation over lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine areas considering multilevel pathology.(1) Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS), has attracted increasing attention within the last decade. The common thread between all minimally invasive spine surgeries is use of smaller incisions and less deterioration of surrounding soft tissue, typically results in less pain after surgery and a faster recovery with reduced length of stay at hospital. The patient reported functional outcome after this procedure was found to be better in comparison with the open approach procedures.(2) Therapeutic exercise post-operatively was programmed to maximize recovery and to minimize potential future problems including disability and improving quality of life. Three different approaches for post-operative management has been practiced including: 1. Recovery phase: 4 to 16 weeks of limited activity following the surgery, 2. eliminating post-operative activity restriction leads to enhanced short-term outcomes for patients after limited open discectomy, 3. Incorporating therapeutic exercise intervention program.(3) The purpose of therapeutic exercise post-operatively was to maximize recovery and to minimize potential future problems including disability and improving quality of life. (4)The therapeutic intervention program comprises of two components: patient education and exercise therapy based on protocols by clinical expertise considering the philosophy of surgeon. Patient education comprises of a one hour counseling session. Therapeutic exercise program encompasses trunk strengthening exercises (both isometrics and dynamics) along with core stabilization exercises and endurance training.

Mobilization applications are easier and safer than manipulation applications involving forceful pushing. Although there are many literatures reporting the therapeutic efficacy of long-term mobilization applications on LDH, there is no study on the effect of applications on radiological findings of LDH.\n\nIn the light of the information mentioned above, the aim of this study is; To examine the effect of mobilization applications on radiological findings and functional level in patients with LDH","detailedDescription":"Disc herniation is the herniation of the nucleus pulposus, which is the disc material, into the spinal canal along the fibers of the annulus fibrosus. Spinal herniations that affect the whole spine are most common in the lumbar region, and most often in the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels in this region. Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common cause of low back pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy, resulting in disability. Depending on the size of the herniation, the nerve is compressed in the lateral recess or in the foraminal or extraforaminal space. The pathophysiology of pain includes direct nerve root compression and local inflammation. Scientists have found that myelography is not as sensitive as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing lumbar disc herniation, and MRI has a higher positivity rate. Compared with computed tomography, it has more imaging parameters, multiple tissue variable functions, more flexible and comprehensive, no radiation and no harm to the human body, and the diagnostic accuracy is better than CT scanning. Because of these advantages, MRI is the gold standard imaging method in the diagnosis of LDH. There are various treatment options available for LDH patients. These are basically divided into 2 categories: surgical and conservative care. Conservative care includes oral medications, corticosteroid and anesthetic infiltrations (nerve root injections), bed rest, exercise therapy, flexion/distraction therapy, manipulation and mobilization.Mobilization applications are passive movements that do not involve pushing or stimuli, applied within the range of motion or up to the physiological range of motion. Mobilization has mechanical effects such as increasing tissue flexibility, separating adhesions, relieving joint limitation and reducing intra-articular pressure. Evidence suggests that mobilizations cause a neurophysiological effect that results in sympathetic arousal, reduced neural mechanical sensitivity, mechanical hypoalgesia, and normalized muscle activity, endurance, and pain-free strength.There are many studies on the clinical use of mobilization methods. While most of these studies examine the effects of mobilization on pain and functional status in patients with low back pain, there are also studies examining the effects of mobilization on pain, functional status and activities of daily living in patients with LDH. In the literature, it has been determined that regression in the lumbar disc herniation distance is achieved with conservative treatment and medical treatment approaches. It is observed that there are studies examining the effect of manipulation on the herniation distance, which is one of the non-invasive Spinal Decompression Therapy method and Manual therapy methods. However, there is no study in the literature investigating the regression of spinal mobilization applications in LDH patients.The aim of our study is to examine the effects of spinal mobilization applications applied in three different planes in addition to stabilization exercises on radiological findings such as herniation distance, disc height and facet joint distance in LDH patients. Apart from radiological findings, it was also aimed to investigate the effects of patients on functional status, pain and flexibility."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intervertebral Disc Displacement","Disk Herniated Lumbar","Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Lumbar disc herniation","Manual Therapies","Mobilization","Stabilization Exercises"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"This study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.

Cervical radiculopathy, a common cause of neck and radiating arm pain, is estimated to afflict 83:100,000 individuals yearly. Age-related cervical spondylosis and disc herniation are the most common causes, with the C6 and C7 nerve roots most frequently affected. In general, patients who experience new onset radicular pain tend to improve within 4-6 months, with complete recovery in over 80% of patients by 24-36 months. However, a significant proportion of patients experience severe pain and associated functional impairment despite conservative care, which often prompts physician directed interventions.\n\nCervical transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) is a target-specific treatment for refractory radicular pain. Analgesic mechanisms for epidural steroid administration include reducing inflammation at the nerve root, reducing nociceptive input from somatic nerves, stabilization of neural membranes, and blockade of C fiber activity in the dorsal root ganglion . Previously, this procedure was associated with rare but catastrophic neurologic injury, though to be related to inadvertent deposit of particulate steroid into the vertebral artery or radiculomedullary arteries, both of which traverse through or close to the cervical neuroforamina . Since the physician community has adopted new guidelines that include the use of only non-particulate steroid during cervical TFESI , neurologic infarction has not been reported in the literature. When the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) clinical practice guidelines are employed, large cohort study demonstrates zero prevalence of serious complications associated with this procedure .\n\nWhile high-quality outcome literature demonstrates both efficacy and effectiveness for analogous use of this intervention in the lumbar spine, far fewer studies have addressed clinical outcomes associated with cervical TFESI in which appropriate procedure technique , outcome measurement, data analysis, and results interpretation have been reported . Outcome literature reporting on the use of cervical TFESI is limited by small sample size, retrospective design with loss of follow-up, lack of categorical data analysis, and a failure to stratify results by demographic and clinical variables that potentially influence pain and functional outcomes. Further, outcome literature reports on the effect of particulate steroid injectate during cervical TFESI is no longer relevant to appropriate clinical practice in the context of unequivocal guidelines. Pragmatic studies with a cervical TFESI arm in which dexamethasone was use do allow for some insight regarding success rates associated with this procedure; calculates of success rates in these studies arms demonstrate responder rates of 60% achieving \\>50% pain relief (CI95 35-85%) at 4 weeks, 55% achieving \\>50% (CI95 43-67%) at 8 weeks, and 65% achieving \\>50% at 12 weeks (CI95 48-81%). These responder rates are encouraging, but limited by wide 95% confidence intervals due to small sample size. Prior systematic review has concluded that the evidence for treatment benefit of radicular pain by cervical TFESI is of very low quality due to multiple limitations in study design introducing risk of bias, but does overall suggest approximately 50% patients experience 50% relief of radicular pain for at least 4 weeks after cervical TFESI.\n\nAdditional clinical outcome literature is needed, particularly given recent policy decisions, such as that of Oregon State in relation to ending coverage of epidural steroid injections at any spinal level. Without expansion of the evidence-basis for this important procedure, there is a risk that this treatment option may be taken away from patients suffering from cervical radicular pain by further policy change. A sham-controlled trial, similar to the Ghahreman study, would be ideal; however, due to cost considerations germane to a study designed and conducted in a manner that would prevent any possible criticism from the larger medical community, we instead propose a high-quality, large prospective cohort study as a significant contribution to the literature. Even the best designed trials, such as Dreyfuss' 2006 study, have been underpowered to definitively demonstrate effectiveness; notably, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of treatment responders in this study was 35%. The investigators aim to conduct a large enough cohort study narrow the 95% confidence interval of the proportion of responders substantially. Preliminary data from our center demonstrates a responder rate of 55% at 4-week follow-up (n=22), based on a definition of ≥50% improvement in index pain (Appendix A). These data represent analysis of consecutive patients who underwent cervical TFESI for unilateral radicular pain as a part of a different prospective outcome study at our center, nearing completion. This responder rate represents a conservative estimate of what might be expected in the proposed work, as the current study includes less stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nFurther, the investigators intend to use the results of this study as foundational data from which to propose a randomized controlled study through a large federal funding mechanism. It is imperative that such a trial be conducted by investigators who are experienced with this procedure and understand the appropriate standards for the design and interpretation of the results of a study of a treatment intervention for pain. Our spine research group is well-positioned for this, and we absolutely welcome the input and mentorship of the Spine Intervention Society Research Division, Board of Directors, and other leadership towards this mutual goal."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Radiculopathy","Cervical Spondylosis","Disk, Herniated"],"keywords":["Transforaminal Epidural Injection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Through a research questionnaire, pre-procedure and post procedure NRS pain score for both neck and arm we will obtain data regarding cervical epidural steroid injections via a transforaminal approach for research purposes only.

Central and peripheral sensitization are playing an important role and this can lead to postoperative hypersensitization. Several studies have shown, that gabapentin can be effective to reduce sensitization and postoperative pain. Pregabalin (S-aminomethyl-5-methylhexaninacid) is a further development of gabapentin.

Globally, around 2-3% of the population is affected by this condition, which manifests as tingling, burning, itching, muscle weakness, limb pain, or allodynia. The most frequent cases involve lumbar disc herniations at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels, which typically compress the tibial nerve. This nerve provides motor and sensory innervation to the posterior knee, leg, foot sole, and posterior thigh.\n\nTreatment options for lumbar discopathies range from pharmacological interventions (cytokine inhibitors, analgesics, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamin B12), to ozone injections, nerve root blocks, or surgeries like discectomy. However, conservative physiotherapy approaches, such as therapeutic exercise, axial decompression, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and peripheral electric stimulation, have gained attention for their efficacy in treating lumbar discopathy symptoms.\n\nPhysiotherapy uses electrical currents, applied either directly via needles under ultrasound guidance or non-invasively, to improve the quality of life for individuals with lumbar-origin peripheral nerve involvement. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrolysis (US-guided PE) is being explored for its fibrolytic effects in areas of tendon-nerve fibrosis, such as the proximal hamstring tendon and sciatic nerve, and its potential influence on the autonomic nervous system. This suggests that PE might depolarize peripheral nerve synapses, alleviating chronic irritability.\n\nAlthough Valera et al. have investigated ultrasound-guided PE for neuropathies through the multifidus muscles, no studies have yet focused on PE near the tibial nerve, despite its high incidence in lumbar discopathy cases. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of US-guided PE on the tibial nerve in improving pain and muscle strength in patients with L4-L5 or L5-S1 posterolateral disc herniation compared to sham acupuncture.","detailedDescription":"The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided percutaneous electrolysis (US-guided PE) in reducing pain and improving muscle strength in individuals with posterolateral lumbar disc herniations compared to placebo acupuncture.\n\nTo achieve this, a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blindedclinical trial is proposed with two study groups:\n\n* US-guided PE:\n* Placebo acupuncture Participants in both groups received 3 sessions with periodicity 1:7:14, meaning seven days elapsed between the first and second sessions, and 14 days between the second and third sessions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Posterolateral Disc Herniation L4-L5-S1","Disk Herniated Lumbar"],"keywords":["disc herniation","US guided PE","Lumbar pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"US-guided PE","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Other: US guided PE"]},{"label":"Sham acupuncture group","type":"SHAM_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Other: Sham Acupuncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"US guided PE","description":"The multifidus muscle near the posterior dorsal root (at L4-L5 or L5-S1) was targeted using a transverse ultrasound view, inserting the needle at an 80º short axis or a 45º long axis, based on vessel presence.

The TBI practice is equipped with electronic scheduling, medical record and billing systems. This poses significant advantages for patient recruitment to this project. On a daily basis, the project coordinator/patient recruiters (PC/PR) can access daily schedules for new patients entering the system for all 17 TBI physicians. This can be cross-correlated later with exiting diagnosis of leg pain to ensure maximum capture of potential candidates.\n\nUpon obtaining permission to solicit the patient, the project will be explained and signed informed consent obtained from patients who agree to participate. Non-participants will be solicited for signature to permit us to monitor their progress during the course of their treatment by administering the outcome questionnaires. Those whom do not sign consent to participate or consent to be monitored will continue with their care and be purged from the project records.\n\nPatient Randomization and Blinding of Analysis:\n\nAt the inception of the project and prior to beginning patient recruitment, assignments for 180 participants will be blocked randomized to obtain equal numbers in each treatment group; Orthotrac (OPV) and EZ form brace (EZF). An additional 30 randomizations over the study sample size of 150 will be completed to allow for 10% drop-out rate in each group in case of patient voluntary withdrawal from participation.\n\nRandom assignments will be sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes and will be kept under lock in the office of the surgeon co-investigator . Upon patient signing of informed consent to participate, the project coordinator (PC / PR) will obtain the next consecutive sealed randomization envelope, assign the patient to the random group and deliver group assignment identification to the principal investigator (PI) for warehousing of recruitment data.\n\nThe patient will then be scheduled with the PC who will obtain appropriate demographic information and administer the outcome measures. Measures will be obtained at the same time as recruitment when ever possible. Results from the outcome measures will be sealed in an envelope, unscored, and delivered to the surgeon co-investigator for warehousing and later analysis. In order to maintain blinding of the PC / PR, she will measure the patient and fit him/her for both devices on the initial visit. The PI will have the proper device ordered according to randomization and will check fitting on its delivery.\n\nExperimental Maneuver\n\nPatients who qualify for this study will have persistent leg pain attributed to lumbar HNP and be under typical medical / chiropractic care. At the stage of their entry into this project, the question of surgical intervention may be a realistic alternative. The experimental maneuver will contrast the ability of the OPV vs the EZF to improve symptoms and function. Patients assigned to the OPV group will be measured by the PC / PR and fit for the device. They will receive instructions in its use QID for a minimum of 30 minutes. Patients assigned to the EZF orthotic will be fit for the device and instructed to wear it during weight bearing hours.\n\nPatient Assessment and Outcome Measures:\n\nAt the inception of the patient into the project, either as a participant or non-participant, a baseline assessment will be performed by the PC. Reassessment will be completed at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. The PC will monitor patient status and compliance with typical treatment on a weekly basis through the computerized scheduling and medical record. Telephone contact will be made on a biweekly basis to evaluate self-reported compliance with wear and determine any intervening health care service utilization or medication use using standardized phone interview methods\n\nAssessment measures will include the following:\n\n1. Inception baseline:\n\n   a. Demographic b. Diagnostic c. Pre-episode work status d. Rang of Motion (ROM) i. Flexion / Extension ii. Straight leg raise e. Pain evaluation i. Pain levels (Visual analogue scale) ii. Quantitative pain drawing iii. Medication use f. Functional evaluation i. Oswestry Back Disability index ii. SF - 36\n2. Follow-up evaluations:\n\n   1. Work status\n   2. Rang of Motion (ROM)\n\n   i. Flexion / Extension ii. Straight leg raise c. Pain evaluation i. Pain levels (Visual analogue scale) ii. Quantitative pain drawing iii. Medication use d. Functional evaluation i. Oswestry Back Disability index ii. SF - 36\n3. Bi-weekly telephone contacts\n\n   1. Work status\n   2. Medication use\n   3. Wear compliance\n   4. Other health care utilization\n   5. TBI treatment sessions (PT, DC, MD, injections, surgical scheduling)\n\nPrimary outcome for this project will be quantitative pain levels, using the VAS. Monitoring of medication use is expected to support this outcome. Further primary outcome centering on functionality scores will focus on the Oswestry and SF 36. The SF36 results can be expected to be a useful adjunct in the assessment of patients with low back pain when combined with disease-specific questionnaires (3). All other measures will be used descriptively and as explanatory variables."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Radiating Leg Pain","Disc Protrusion"],"keywords":["Randomized controlled clinical trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Orthotrac Pneumatic Vest"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"VAS"},{"measure":"Oswestry"},{"measure":"SF-36"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"ROM"},{"measure":"Pain drawing"},{"measure":"Medication use"},{"measure":"Wear compliance"},{"measure":"Extra-protocol treatment seeking"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age 21 - 55\n* Preferred no prior surgery or no spine surgery in previous 6 months.\n* VAS \\> 4.0\n* Symptoms unresolved after 4 weeks\n* Minimal antalgic lean of the trunk when initially weight bearing\n* Pain aggravated by weight bearing standing / walking\n* Reduced leg pain on recumbency\n* MRI Confirmed disc bulge / protrusion / herniation (HNP) site consistent with symptoms - preferred.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n· No neurological deficit","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"John J.

More than 40% of the Turkish population has experienced low back pain at least once in their life 2. Intervertebral disc degenerations Lumbal Disc Herniation (LDH), which is frequently represented, can cause motor and sensory losses in the lower extremity by compressing the spinal nerves. Lumbar disc surgery procedure is inevitable in case of advanced functional losses in the related sensory dermatomes and muscles after LDH. Lumbal disc surgeries are performed for the purpose of decompression of nerve pressures on nerves due to advanced disc herniation. they suggest 4.\n\nOne of the most common LDH problems in the community is low foot problems due to weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle, which occurs due to L4-L5 disc herniation, and the accompanying functional disorders. In disc herniations at this level, the activation of the tibialis anterior muscle, which is compressed by the nerve root, decreases compared to the medial gastrocnemius muscle, where it works as an antagonist, and this leads to functional limitations, especially in gait and balance activities.\n\nSpinal stabilization exercises are a concept that emerged from the idea that exercise is important for the provision and preservation of functionality of people with low back and back pain due to LDH. According to this exercise approach, muscles are of great importance in providing lumbar region stability. These muscles are classified as general (global) stabilizing muscles, which are dynamic, phasic, and power-producing muscles, and regional (local) stabilizing muscles, which are postural, tonic, and stabilizer muscles. The main muscles responsible for spine stabilization are multifidus, transversus abdominus and pelvic floor muscles 6. It is argued that increased lumbo-pelvic motor control thanks to spine stabilization facilitates lower extremity activities, especially flexion and extension movements in the sagittal plane. Patients with LDH who increase their motor strength can use lower extremity movements more functionally.\n\nThe aim of this study was to (1) determine the activation rates of the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius muscles during different functional activities in the lower extremities affected and unaffected by LDH, (2) to compare the rates of the affected extremity to the rates of the healthy extremity during coactivation of the transversus abdominus and multifidus muscles (spinal stabilization basic exercise). to determine whether it is close or not. According to the hypothesis of this study, the researchers thought that the functional activities performed together with the activation of the transversus abdominus and multifidus muscles would show coactivation behaviors at a rate closer to the healthy extremity."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disk Herniated Lumbar","Coordination Lack","Muscle Weakness"],"keywords":["disc herniation","electromyography","muscle coactivation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":17,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with L4-5 disc herniation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In the light of the reference research, it was estimated that it could reach an effect size of 0.6 according to the sample size measurement made with at least 80% power and 0.05 margin of error, and 18 individuals with LDH (9 men, 9 women) were planned to participate in this study.

This condition is the second most frequent condition, after the common cold, for which people see a physician or lose days from work. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the U.S. have increased sharply over time, and researchers have documented 15-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries. In many cases, where one lives and who one sees for the problem appear to determine the rates of surgery. Despite these trends, there is little evidence proving the effectiveness of these therapies over non-surgical management.\n\nOverall, the SPORT study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial for the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed: lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS) and spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). This arm of the trial will deal with patients from the first diagnostic group. The study will compare the most commonly used standard surgical treatments to the most commonly used standard non-surgical treatments. We will conduct the study at 12 sites throughout the United States.\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study will be changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire. Secondary endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, utility for current health in order to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) as the measure for cost-effectiveness, resource use, and cost.\n\nWe will follow patients at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to determine their health status, function, satisfaction, and use of health care. In this arm of the trial, we anticipate enrolling and randomly allocating a total of 500 participants. We will track an additional observational cohort to assess health and resource outcomes (1000 participants). Enrollment in the Observational cohort has been completed as of February 2003.\n\nWe will integrate data from the trial and observational cohorts to formally estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical interventions for IDH, SpS, and DS. On the basis of the results of this trial we will, for the first time, have scientific evidence as to the relative effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for these three most commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Herniated Disc","Low Back Pain"],"keywords":["Intervertebral disc herniation (IDH)","Stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS)","Spinal stenosis (SpS)","Low back pain (LBP)","Leg pain","Surgical therapy","Non-surgical therapy","Randomized study","Multicenter","MRI"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":501,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Surgery","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Diskectomy","interventionNames":["Procedure: Diskectomy","Procedure: Non-surgical treatments"]},{"label":"Non-surgical intervention","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Non-surgical treatments","interventionNames":["Procedure: Non-surgical treatments"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Diskectomy","description":"The surgeon will leave the nerve root freely mobile and undamaged following the procedure.

The nerve root will be clearly identified and mobilized and then gently retracted to prepare for the discectomy. Removal of the medial border of the superior facet may, in some cases, be necessary in order to have a clear view of the lateral border of the involved nerve root. Following the clear view of the nerve root and mobilization, the IDH will be approached by making a small annular incision if necessary, the fragment of disc will then be removed (i.e., limited disc excision).

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the real-time effect of specific three-dimensional (3D) positions of the trunk on patients with lumbar discogenic pain with radiculopathy aiming to find a position that directly decompresses the impinged root as well as the effect of this position on the CSA of the L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 intervertebral foramen (IVF) using 3D-CT scan imaging of the real spine. Methods: This study was conducted on ninety male patients (30 in each group), ages ranged from 20 - 40 years old, and were diagnosed with unilateral lumbar disc prolapse (group1: L3-L4), (group 2: L4- L5) and (group 3: L5-S1) for at least three months in a radiology center specialized in the spine (Egyscan center). Each group was imaged three times (from the supine position, then from the oblique position after 10 minutes, and finally from the oblique position again after 48 hours). The oblique image was taken during a specific trunk position the modified reversed contralateral rotation (side-lying on a hard pillow with side bending to the non-affected side and rotation to non affected side).The CSA of LIVF and SLR test were assessed at the three times of testing Results: The mixed design MANOVA revealed that the mean values of the LIVF CSA and the SLR significantly increased in the reversed contralateral rotation position after 48 hours compared to the same position after 10 minutes and the supine position in the three tested groups (P=0.001). Moreover, the LIVF CSA and the SLR significantly increased in the reversed contralateral rotation position after 10 minutes compared to the supine position in the three tested groups (P=0.001). Conclusion: Modified reversed contralateral rotation of the trunk has a real-time decompressing effect on patients with lumbar disc prolapse as well as a significantly increasing effect on the CSA of L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 IVF in the three tested groups.

All data was taken from the patients' medical records with single-level LDH (Lumbar Disc Herniation) following TPELD. Patients with incomplete data and those who underwent revision surgery were excluded. The collected data were regarding the sociodemographic characteristics of the patients (age and gender), surgical time, pre-operative pain scale (1-10), postoperative pain scale, complications, and weight of the removed disc and ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) score. The preoperative pain scale was assessed within 48 hours before the surgery while the post-operative pain scale was assessed at one month and three months after the surgery. The reduction of pain was assessed, comparing the pre-operative pain scale and the post-operative pain scale at 1 month and 3 months follow up.\n\nPre TPELD MRI data and 3 months post TPELD were collected to evaluate the percentage of disc removed referring to the quantification of the axial MRI by two independent radiology department personnel. The area of the bulging disc was measured using as many points as the user felt were necessary in order to trace a reasonable outline of disc herniation.\n\nAll of the TPELD procedures are performed by a single spine surgeon with only using one type of endoscopic instrumentation in one level LDH. The surgeon was not involved during data collection and data were collected by independent assessors.\n\nThe statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0. investigator tested all the numeric variables with the Shapiro-Wilk test for the normality of distribution. The surgeon's learning curve was evaluated using negative curve-fit regression analysis (y = ae-bx+ c) described by Silva, et al (2013).

Fusion of the discs follows in about 70% of cases.\n\nAdjacent disc disease (ADD), symptomatic degenerative changes in the levels adjacent to the operated level is regarded as a late complication. Fusion at the operated level is thought to contribute to this process due to compensative increased mobility and stress on the adjacent segments.\n\nKeeping the operated segment mobile through the use of a cervical disc prosthesis possibly prevents ADD.\n\nWe hypothesize that use of a cervical disc prosthesis preserves or restores normal mobility to the cervical spine. To test this hypothesis subjects are randomised in a group receiving a standard anterior cervical discectomy, and a group receiving a standard discectomy with placement of a cervical disc prosthesis. Digital X-ray cinematographic videos are made of a flexion/extension movement. The videos will be analyzed manually and through a newly designed automated program, to check for mobility and order of movement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diskectomy","Intervertebral Disk Displacement"],"keywords":["Cervical degenerative disc disease","Anterior cervical discectomy","Cervical disc prosthesis","Activ-C","Mobility","Movement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Anterior cervical discectomy, no disc prosthesis","interventionNames":["Procedure: Anterior cervical discectomy"]},{"label":"2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Anterior cervical discectomy, with disc prosthesis","interventionNames":["Device: Activ C disc prosthesis","Procedure: Anterior cervical discectomy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Activ C disc prosthesis","description":"cervical disc prosthesis","armGroupLabels":["2"],"otherNames":["Activ C cervical disc prosthesis, B.Braun/Aesculap Spine"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Anterior cervical discectomy","description":"Removal of protruding cervical disc through an anterior approach","armGroupLabels":["1","2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Order of movement","timeFrame":"baseline, 3 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Segmental mobility","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Treatment of symptoms (pain, neurological assessment)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 12 months"},{"measure":"Influence on subjects functioning (social, work)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* indication for anterior cervical discectomy\n* monoradicular syndrome caused by compression at C5-6 or C6-7\n* monosegmental disease on MRI\n* able to actively perform flexion/extension movement\n* segmental mobility on the afflicted level \\>2 degrees of rotation\n* informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* previous operative interventions on the cervical spine\n* multiple segments afflicted\n* positive L'Hermittes sing\n* Active infection\n* Immature bone\n* Tumorous processes in the cervical region\n* Previous radiation therapy in the cervical region\n* Pregnancy\n* Cervical myelopathy\n* not able to speak Dutch","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"overallOfficials":[{"name":"H van Santbrink, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Department of Neurosurgery, Maastricht University Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Maastricht University Medical Center","city":"Maastricht","state":"Limburg","zip":"6229 HX","country":"Netherlands","geoPoint":{"lat":50.84833,"lon":5.68889}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"25887569","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Boselie TF, van Mameren H, de Bie RA, van Santbrink H.

Chronic low back pain also results in many missed days of work and so is an economic burden as well as a social one. Subacute and chronic conservative treatment of low back pain secondary to a herniated disc of the lower back includes education, lifestyle modifications, and maintenance of a normal body mass index. Physical therapy includes range of motion, strengthening and aerobic exercises alongside use of physical therapy modalities such as superficial heating, low frequency analgesic modalities such as TENS and deep heating modalities such as ultrasonic waves and short wave diathermy.\n\nIn Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation departments in Turkey, diathermy is commonly used as an adjunct to exercise in the inpatient treatment of disc herniation of the lumbar region. However, systematic reviews of the effects of diathermy in the form of ultrasound and short wave emphasise the necessity for further studies of their efficacy in the treatment of pain and impact on functionality and quality of life.\n\nTherefore, in this study the investigators aim to compare the efficacy of ultrasound and short wave diathermy in treating pain, improving disability and quality of life in patients with chronic low back pain secondary to disc herniation of the lumbar vertebrae."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Radiculopathy","Low Back Pain, Mechanical","Herniated Disk Lumbar"],"keywords":["lumbar vertebrae","herniated disc","radiculopathy","low back pain","short wave therapy","diathermy","ultrasonic waves"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"FACTORIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Three groups of patients, each containing 31 patients, will be included in the study.

It is a worldwide problem with a global incidence of 9.4% and causes more disability than any other condition in the world. The percentage of adults who experience chronic low back pain throughout their lives ranges from 51% to 84% . As the population ages, the incidence of surgery for low back pain increases dramatically; the number of lumbar fusions increased by 170% from 1998 to 2008. Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) has been reported to affect 10 to 40% of patients following spine surgery, but estimating the incidence of FBSS is difficult due to the wide scope of its definition and heterogeneous etiology. Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as \"lumbar spinal pain of unknown origin that persists despite surgical intervention or occurs after surgical intervention for pain in the same topographic region\". Pain may occur after surgery, surgery may exacerbate existing pain or not adequately improve it. Patients with FBSS have undergone one or more surgical interventions that do not cure long-standing chronic low back pain and pain, with or without radicular symptoms. Its etiology is complex and it is a condition with many factors that predispose patients to chronic pain. Epidural fibrosis, perineural scars, acquired stenosis, recurrent disc herniation or pain of the sacroiliac/facet joints are thought to play a role in the etiology of FBSS. Pain in the leg likely indicates nerve compression from stenosis, epidural fibrosis, or disc herniation, while low back pain is more common in facet joint arthropathy, sacroiliac joint problems, or myofascial etiologies. For the failed back surgery syndrome patient, physical examination is usually not helpful in identifying a specific aetiology of pain, but may reveal several suggestive findings. Symptoms from spinal stenosis are usually exacerbated by spinal extension and relieved by flexion. On the other hand, pain from disc herniation causes a positive straight leg raise test. Loss of strength or sensation in the lower extremities can help to understand which nerve roots are affected. Other tests may be used to elucidate the etiology of failed back surgery syndrome and differentiate it from other causes of low back pain. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein can be used to evaluate possible infection, especially in patients with structural symptoms or susceptibility to infection. Diagnostic nerve blocks can diagnose specific etiologies of FBSS, such as facet joint arthropathy (medial bundle blocks), sacroiliac joint pain (lateral bundle branch blocks and intra-articular injection), and foraminal stenosis (transforaminal epidural and selective unilevel blocks) and roots associated with the patient's symptoms. can define. MRI with and without gadolinium contrast remains the gold standard imaging modality for failed back surgery syndrome, as it can perfectly detect soft tissue abnormalities such as epidural fibrosis and disc herniation. Contrast is particularly indicated in patients with a history of disc herniation surgery. A panel of international spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, and pain specialists with a special interest in FBSS established the Chronic Low Back and Leg Pain (CBLP) network to address the challenges and barriers in the clinical management of FBSS patients, creating a collaborative interdisciplinary body. The definition of FBSS proposed by the CBLP network is based on the assumption that no further spine surgery is required after an appropriate somatic, radiological, and psychosocial assessment. The key elements for the definition of FBSS can be summarized in 4 aspects:\n\n1. There is low back and/or leg pain that persists for at least 6 months after the last spine surgery\n2. Patient has undergone a comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation\n3. There is no clear surgical target consistent with the symptoms revealed on clinical examination and imaging\n4. There is an interdisciplinary consensus that additional surgical intervention (decompression and/or fusion) is not appropriate.\n\nDespite its adverse effects on patients and its relative prevalence in the spine surgery population, few high-quality randomized studies have investigated the treatment of FBSS. Treatments for FBSS are generally divided into conservative (physical therapy or drug therapy) and aggressive (interventional or surgical) management. Conservative treatment should always be the first choice before invasive techniques in patients without an indication for emergency surgery. Various studies have shown that caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI) is an effective method in patients with FBSS who do not respond to conservative pain relief treatments . Çelenlioğlu A. et al. investigators compared the success of transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI ) and CESI treatment in patients who developed FBSS after single-level discectomy. In two prospective randomized studies, both CESI and TFESI (transforaminal epidural steroid injection) were found to be effective and safe in treatment. CESI has been shown to be the safest and simplest ESI with a low complication rate, including dural puncture and other side effects, compared to other injection methods. Yoon et al. reported a success rate of 94% with US-guided caudal blockade. In a study conducted by Akkaya et al. when ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI) were compared to patients with FBSS, a decrease in both pain and ODI (oswestry disabilite index)scores was achieved in both groups at 3-month follow-up, and CESI was found to be effective in the treatment of FBSS. has been reported. In a prospective randomized controlled study comparing the treatment success of caudal epidural steroid injection with ultrasonography (USG) and fluoroscopy in postlaminectomy patients, no difference was found between the two groups in terms of complications, while the patients in the fluoroscopy group felt more pain during the procedure than the patients in the USG group. Despite correct needle localization and drug injection under fluoroscopy guidance, radiation is still a serious risk for both patient and responder. The use of USG in caudal epidural injections protects from radiation exposure, and is a safe and rapid method for locating the sacral hiatus and guiding the needle. Color Doppler USG can view intravenous injections. Tsui et al. reported that the color Doppler feature of USG could confirm whether the injected drug was diffused to the caudal area. Injection of fluid into the epidural space causes turbulent flow, which appears as a burst of color, while intrathecal injection indicates the absence of color flow Doppler signal. Although the precise pathophysiological process of FBSS remains unclear, growing evidence suggests that widespread pain distribution, hyperalgesia, and disproportionate pain intensity symptoms, which are also common in other chronic pain-related diseases (e.g., fibromyalgia, tension-type headache, and nonspecific chronic low back pain), are a potential risk factor. predicts that central sensitization may develop. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defined CS in 2011 as \"the increased response of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to normal or sub-threshold afferent inputs.\" Anxiety about pain, restriction of daily activities, quality of life and the stress associated with it lead to depression over time and thus a vicious cycle of \"pain-anxiety-depression\" begins. Altered central pain modulation may be involved in the pathogenesis of FBSS. Unfortunately, only a few studies have investigated the presence of central sensitization, although it may guide the treatment of patients with FBSS. Central amplification of pain may contribute to both chronic low back pain intensity and disability in FBSS patients. Therefore, targeted therapies should consider functional changes in the central nervous system of FBSS patients, and treatment modalities that can weaken central sensitization (eg, cognitive-targeted exercise therapy, pharmacotherapy, spinal cord stimulation) may be beneficial in the treatment of FBSS. Our aim is to reveal the relationship between FBSS and central sensitization proportionally, keeping in mind that central sensitization may develop in post-spinal surgery patients with ongoing pain, to prevent the formation of a vicious circle of chronic pain with its early detection and treatment, and to prevent the formation of a vicious circle of chronic pain. Moreover, caudal epidural steroid injection with USG does not have radiation exposure and it is advantageous and beneficial. Since it is a reliable method, investigators aim to determine its effectiveness in patients with FBSS. As far as investigators know, such a study has not been reported before in the literature, investigators hope that investigators will contribute to the literature."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Herniated Disc","Failed Back Surgery Syndrome"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"3 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"group 1 (with central sensitization)","description":"Group: group 1 (with central sensitization) 8 mg betamethasone, 3 cc bupivacaine, 5 cc serum will be injected in the neck, and caudal force pressure, pressure pain thresholds will be evaluated with a manual algometer, accompanied by ultrasonography.\n\nGroup: group 2 (without central sensitization) 8 mg betamethasone, 3 cc bupivacaine, 5 cc serum will be injected in the neck, and caudal force pressure, pressure pain thresholds will be evaluated with a manual algometer, accompanied by ultrasonography.","interventionNames":["Drug: Betametasona"]},{"label":"group 2 (without central sensitization)","description":"Group: group 1 (with central sensitization) 8 mg betamethasone, 3 cc bupivacaine, 5 cc serum will be injected in the neck, and caudal force pressure, pressure pain thresholds will be evaluated with a manual algometer, accompanied by ultrasonography.\n\nGroup: group 2 (without central sensitization) 8 mg betamethasone, 3 cc bupivacaine, 5 cc serum will be injected in the neck, and caudal force pressure, pressure pain thresholds will be evaluated with a manual algometer, accompanied by ultrasonography.","interventionNames":["Drug: Betametasona"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Betametasona","description":"pressure pain threshold values of the most painful area will be recorded with a manual algometer","armGroupLabels":["group 1 (with central sensitization)","group 2 (without central sensitization)"],"otherNames":["baseline brand algometer"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numeric Rating Scale /NRS","description":"At least 50 percent improvement in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS more than fifty percent reduction indicates greater improvement.

According to the national spine registries in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, there is a 30-60% difference in surgical incidence between these countries. The cause for this difference is not known. It may reflect a difference in incidence of lumbar disc hernia, but with a similar socio-economic and ethnical background in these countries, it is more likely that the differences are due to varying surgical indications. Comparing indications for surgery, patient reported outcome and factors predictive for outcome after surgery for lumbar disc hernia in these countries could provide information about optimal indications for surgery.\n\nHypotheses: (i) there are no differences in patient-reported outcome after surgery between these countries, (ii) there are no differences in indications for surgery between these countries and (iii), factors that predict outcome are similar in these countries.\n\nMethod of research: By using data from three Nordic national spine registers, we will compare baseline data, indications for surgery and patient reported outcome one year after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. Register based studies have advantages such as large sample sizes, reflecting real life, but they also have limitations such as lower follow-up rates than clinical trials. A non-response analysis will be performed to take this into account.","detailedDescription":"This is an observational register based study, with prospective data registration and a retrospective study design. Included are individuals treated surgically for a lumbar disc herniation between the ages of 18 through 65 years, without a history of previous lumbar spine surgery. Surgery has been performed in Denmark, Norway or Sweden during 2011, 2012 or 2013. Data will be presented according to the STROBE criteria.\n\nThe registers\n\nAll registries have the aim of studying outcome after spine surgery. All departments and patients participate voluntarily. At the time of admission, the patient reports data consisting of information on social factors, comorbidity and previous surgery. After surgery, the surgeon records diagnosis and type of surgery performed.\n\nThe Swespine Register has included individuals treated with surgery for lumbar disc herniation since 1993. During the last decade, the number of departments participating in the registry has varied between 35 and 41 of the 42 to 45 departments providing spinal surgery services in Sweden. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness (number of patients reported to Swespine at the time of surgery) is approximately 80%.\n\nThe Norwegian Spine register, NORspine, is based on experiences from the Swespine register and previous validation studies from a local clinical registry, and was founded in 2007. In total 36 of 40 centers performing lumbar spine surgery in Norway report to NORspine. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness is approximately 65%.\n\nThe Danish spine register, DaneSpine, is based on Swespine and was acquired by the Danish Spine Society from the Swedish Society of Spinal Surgeons in 2009 and has successively been implemented. In total 17 of 19 centers performing lumbar spine surgery in Denmark report to DaneSpine. Coverage is approximately 90%. The completeness is approximately 60%.\n\nQuality assurance\n\nAs for all studies, there is a risk that loss to follow-up may bias the results. Solberg et al. (2011) studied 633 patients, who were operated on for degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine in Norway, and found that a loss to follow-up of 22% would not bias conclusions about overall treatment effects. There were no indications of worse outcomes in the non-responders group. In a similar one-center study of the DaneSpine. Højmark et al. (2016) found that a loss to follow-up of 12% at did not seem to bias the conclusions that can be drawn from DaneSpine at that center. Preliminary data indicates that predictors of outcome after lumbar disc herniation surgery are comparable with data in a study with a very high follow-up rate and with the Swespine register.\n\nData handling\n\nAnonymized individual level data from all three registers will be pooled in one database. The cohort will be divided by country for comparisons.\n\nMissing data and out of range data\n\nIn case of missing data case exclusion analysis by analysis, will be used. Out of range data will be deleted.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe data will be cleaned by excluding patients with missing or incorrect date of surgery, missing date for follow-up, previous lumbar spine surgery and surgery other than discectomy only.\n\nAfter data cleaning, we aim to perform blinded statistical analyses, in which the independent statistician performing the analyses is unaware of group belonging (i.e. country). The code will not be broken until the analyses and interpretations have been performed.\n\nComparisons of indications for surgery\n\nAnalysis of baseline data will include age at surgery, sex, anthropometrics, number of smokers, Oswestry Disability Index, numeric rating scale leg pain, numeric rating scale back pain, EQ-5D, number on sick leave, employment status, and duration of leg and back pain and presented as mean (SD), mean (95% confidence interval), or number (%).\n\nVariables will be analyzed by analysis of variance, Chi-square or logistic regression tests. Data will be presented as crude (unadjusted) data to elucidate any differences between the countries.\n\nComparisons of outcome\n\nComparisons of the change of the outcome variables from baseline to 1 year, as well as comparisons of the actual value at 1 year will be performed. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), Chi-square or logistic regression tests will be used and the crude (unadjusted) data will be presented.\n\nThe baseline variables will be used as covariates in the ANCOVA and the adjusted data presented. Additionally, the results from the ANCOVA will be compared with results from propensity score matching or ANCOVA with the propensity score as a covariate.\n\nNon-response analysis\n\nA non-response analysis will be performed comparing all available baseline variables between those that responded to the 1 year follow-up with those that did not respond.\n\nSample size\n\nA study of similar character has never been performed before. Due to the nature of the study, the sample size is not formulated in the guise of power, risk level, or clinical difference. The number of patients participating in the study is estimated to 7500. The sample is so large that differences in the Oswestry Disability Index of as low as 2 points may be detected (power 90%, significance level 5%), but in the interpretation the minimal important difference of 10-15 points in the Oswestry Disability Index often referred to has to be taken into account."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intervertebral Disc Displacement","Sciatica"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"1 Year","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Disc hernia patients treated in Sweden","description":"Individuals undergoing lumbar disc hernia surgery and included in the Swespine register","interventionNames":["Procedure: Lumbar disc hernia surgery"]},{"label":"Disc hernia patients treated in Norway","description":"Individuals undergoing lumbar disc hernia surgery and included in the NORspine register","interventionNames":["Procedure: Lumbar disc hernia surgery"]},{"label":"Disc hernia patients treated in Denmark","description":"Individuals undergoing lumbar disc hernia surgery and included in the Danespine register","interventionNames":["Procedure: Lumbar disc hernia surgery"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Lumbar disc hernia surgery","armGroupLabels":["Disc hernia patients treated in Denmark","Disc hernia patients treated in Norway","Disc hernia patients treated in Sweden"],"otherNames":["Surgery for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Oswestry disability index","description":"Index at baseline, index change from preoperative to 1 year follow-up and actual index at 1 year follow-up.\n\nOswestry disability index version 2.1 (from 0; no disability to 100; maximum disability)","timeFrame":"preoperative and 1 year postoperative"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Numerical rating scale for leg pain","description":"Index at baseline, index change from preoperative to 1 year follow-up and actual index at 1 year follow-up.\n\nNumerical rating scale for leg pain (from 0; no pain to 10; maximum pain).

The Randomized controlled trials done at Armed Forces Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Rawalpindi. The sample size was 20. The subjects were divided in two groups, 10 subjects in conventional physical therapy group and 10 in ELDOA stretching exercise group. Study duration was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was Convenient Sampling technique randomization in group through Lottery method (sealed envelope). Only 30-60 years individuals with cervical disc protrusion were included. Tools used in the study were measurement of ROM by bubble inclinometer, Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) and neck disability index (NDI). Data was analyzed using SPSS 21.","detailedDescription":"Cervical disc protrusion is a significant cause of neck and arm pain and disability in majority of individuals. It causes a great burden on physical, social and emotional quality of life of patients. The cervical disc protrusion is characterized by prolapsed nuclear material through the annulus into the spinal canal. The local mechanical or chemical irritation of neural structures typically leads to symptoms of radiculopathy, head and neck pain or myelopathy. The disc protrusion may be postero-central to compress the dura matter, causing multi segmental pain and affect the scapular area. It can also be postero-lateral causing the root signs, which have dermatomal behavior and affect the upper limb in specific pattern. Postero-central protrusion can also shift to postero-lateral with symptoms shifting from centralization to radiculopathy.\n\nSymptomatic disc protrusions can occur at any age but have different clinical features depending on the age group. In young adults nucleus pulposus can involve which is rare in old age. Diagnoses can be established on clinical findings along with patient's history, the functional examination and MRI. Disc protrusion can occur in postero-central, lateral and Postero- lateral directions.\n\nMovement of the disc posteriorly causes stress on the posterior longitudinal ligament and also on the anterior part of the Dura mater. As a result of this the pain travels in more than one segment with dural reference. This typical postero central protrusion causes the pain symptoms centrally and bilaterally. Postero lateral disc protrusion may irritate the nerve root, which causes a Segmental or root pain and paraesthesia. The goal of treatment in disc protrusion problems is to stop the conflict between the displaced disc material and affecting sensitive structure. Protruded disc fragment may affect the Dura matter, nerve roots and intervertebral joints.\n\nELDOA is a series of stretching exercises and body movements that uses the Centre of gravity and localizes a target area of the spine that need to be mobilized or re aligned by placing and maintaining tension on the fascia. In ELDOA improvement in the tone of the intrinsic muscles of the spine combined with reinforcing the extrinsic muscles related to the spine in the neck. The stretching of the interlinking Para spinal muscles and finally inter independent movement of \"Junghans functional unit\" is facilitated and it is emphasized that micro movement affects macro function. The basic working principle during an ELDOA stretching consists of creating a position that will target a specific segment i.e. the functional unit. The inferior segment is fixed while the superior segment is mobilized. The position is created in such to place all the inferior and superior myofascial chains under tension. The effects of ELDOA include decompression of the superior and inferior facet joints, allowing for more space, joint play, and the range of motion.\n\nExcept ELDOA the other different treatment methods for intervertebral disc protrusion includes the application of physical modalities, mechanical traction, specific physical therapeutic exercise, oral anti-inflammatory medication, and patient education. Disc decompression therapy, surgery, minimally invasive Oxygen- Ozone therapy that exploits the biochemical properties of a gas mixture of Oxygen and Ozone and administration of periganglionic injection of corticosteroid and an anesthetic agent.\n\nPhysiotherapy treatment protocol for cervical disc protrusion includes cervical traction, neural mobilization and cervical spine strengthening exercises to relieve stress on the muscles. ELDOA stretching exercise is a systematic technique that causes decompression of the superior and inferior facets of the involved segment, allowing for more space, joint play, and the range of motion. This study hypothesize that there is a difference between the effects of conventional physical therapy treatment and ELDOA stretching exercise for the disc protrusion. The objective of this study is to find the effects of ELDOA stretching technique and to compare it with conventional physical therapy treatment in patients with cervical disc protrusion.\n\nLiterature review A systematic and evidence based search of relevant literature was performed by utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar as search engines.\n\nSearch term for the initial literature review was disc protrusion, prevalence of neck pain, causes of neck pain, pathophysiology of disc protrusion, treatment options for disc protrusion, effects of ELDOA in disc protrusion. The search was limited to papers in English preferably published since 2000 with full text available. Different studies were available regarding cervical manipulation and its effects but limited data was available regarding the effects of ELDOA on cervical disc protrusion in recent years.\n\nIn 2016,The prevalence of playing related injuries in collegiate violinists and the physical, emotional, and mental effects of ELDOA. Conducted an exploratory study to investigate the effects of ELDOA on the perceived pain in collegiate violinists at Jacob School of Music Indiana University. The study findings were overall decrease in pain and some study participants indicated the physical, emotional, and mental benefits after doing ELDOA exercises such as improve body posture, increase flexibility, mobility, and range of motion. Participants also noticed a change in mental behavior as decrease in stress, anxiety, improved sleep patterns and some participants did not observed as much emotional or mental benefits as others.\n\nQuasi experimental short time study on Fascia Stretching Improve the Pain and Functional Level in Disc Protrusion Patients: JRCRS; 2016. The study participants were administered ELDOA exercises with conservative physical therapy treatment in both cervical and lumbar disc protrusions. The result of this study showed that ELDOA has significant result to decrease pain and improved functional status of the subjects. The pre and post-treatment frequency and intensity of pain showed significant differences.\n\nIn a study on incidence of intervertebral disc protrusion disclosed by postmortem radiography and myelography, 60 % of patients over the age of 30 years have multiple anterior and lateral disc protrusion of witch 40% were posterior disc protrusions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Cervical Disc Protrusion","ELDOA,","Neck Pain","Neck Disability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conservative physical therapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Moist hot packs, TENS, Cervical Traction, Neural Mobilization, Cervical Spine strengthening exercises","interventionNames":["Other: Conservative physical therapy"]},{"label":"ELDOA stretching exercise","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"ELDOA stretching exercise protocol along with Conservative physical therapy","interventionNames":["Other: ELDOA stretching exercise"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conservative physical therapy","description":"Moist hot packs, TENS, Cervical Traction, Neural Mobilization on alternate days Cervical Spine strengthening exercises 10 repetitions×1 set, 4 days/week.

Since some patients may experience persistent pain and the potential development risk of failed back surgery syndrome, minimally invasive procedures are preferred as a pre-surgical intervention.\n\nInterlaminar or transforaminal epidural steroid injections are the most commonly used nonsurgical interventions for disc herniation. Ozone therapy has also started to be used as frequently as steroids. Previous studies have shown that ozone can be given through intradiscally, epidural space, and paravertebral muscles. Ozone gase is thought to modulate levels of cytokines and prostaglandins, minimize reactive oxidant species levels, and improve local periganglionic circulation.\n\nThe objective of this study was to assess the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of transforaminal epidural steroid and steroid plus ozone injection in patients presenting with low back and radicular leg pain and to analyze which treatment method is most beneficial in reducing pain relief.\n\nThis was a retrospective study of 120 patients who underwent transforaminal epidural steroid or combination of steroid and ozone injection between June and December 2020 in the Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pain Medicine.\n\nDemographic information, pain intensity, localization, pattern (neuropathic/nonneuropathic/mix), and patients' quality of life and the treated level (the innervation territories of L2 (Lomber), L3, L4, L5, or S1 (Sacral)) were analyzed. Pain intensity was assessed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and patient disability was evaluated with the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI).\n\nOne group included patients who underwent transforaminal epidural steroid and ozone injection, and another group included patients who underwent transforaminal epidural steroid injection alone. In both groups, two mL of dexamethasone (8 mg) and 3 mL of saline were used for each transforaminal epidural injection level. Patients who received combination therapy were injected 5ml of ozone at a concentration of 28 g/ml in addition to steroids for each level.\n\nThe investigators evaluated the patients' records of VAS and ODI scores on the day of the procedure and at the 24th hours (for VAS only) 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th months after the procedure. Patients' satisfaction was assessed using modified MacNab scale scores after the 1st and 12th months. The post-treatment results of the patients were compared between the two groups and with the baseline."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Low Back Pain","Radiculopathy Lumbar","Hernia","Disk Herniated Lumbar"],"keywords":["Low back pain","Injections","Steroids","Ozone","Disk Herniated Lumbar"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"The patients who underwent transforaminal epidural steroid and ozone injection","description":"Patients who received combination therapy were injected 5ml of ozone at a concentration of 28 g/ml and two mL of dexamethasone (8 mg) and 3 mL of saline for each transforaminal epidural injection level under fluoroscopy guidance","interventionNames":["Procedure: Fluoroscopy Guided Transforaminal Epidural Ozone Injection","Procedure: Fluoroscopy Guided Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection"]},{"label":"The patients who underwent transforaminal epidural steroid injection alone","description":"Patients who received transforaminal epidural steroid injection were injected two mL of dexamethasone (8 mg) and 3 mL of saline for each transforaminal epidural injection level.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Fluoroscopy Guided Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Fluoroscopy Guided Transforaminal Epidural Ozone Injection","description":"All procedures were performed under light sedation in a sterile operating room.

Optimum maintenance of home care of patients who underwent surgery after discharge is possible with an effective discharge education given to the patient and their relatives and the preparation of the patients. In this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of the discharge training given to the patients who underwent Lumbar Disc Herniation Surgery with the method of feedback on their readiness for discharge and their satisfaction with the discharge training.\n\nAmong the patient groups who were given and not trained by the teach-back method; H01. There is no difference between the scores of readiness for discharge. H02. There is no difference between discharge training satisfaction scores. H11: There is a difference between the scores of being ready for discharge. H12: There is a difference between discharge training satisfaction scores.","detailedDescription":"While the discharge plan and education of the surgical patient constitute an important part of nursing care, it is also an indispensable element in improving the patient's quality of life. Early discharge training after lumbar disc herniation surgery relieves the patient's anxiety and facilitates compliance with the treatment. Patients' readiness for discharge includes adequate recovery for safe discharge, physical stability, functional ability, ability to manage self-care at home, and coping skills. The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of discharge training given by the Teach Back Method on patients with lumbar disc herniation surgery on their readiness for discharge. The second aim of the study is to determine the satisfaction of the patients in the group using the Teach Back Method at discharge training.\n\nMethod Study design and setting: This randomized controlled trial will conduct at the Neurosurgery Service of Famagusta State Hospital and the Neurosurgery Clinic of the Nicosia Doctor Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital.\n\nSampling: The sample size of the study, the significance level of the hypothesis and the effect size were taken into account and the statistical power calculation related to the analyzes was made on the G Power 3.1.9.4 computer program. In the calculation made, the number of units in the sample was calculated as at least 68 people, 34 in each group, under the assump tions of 95% confidence interval, 80% power, and effect size 0.50.\n\nRandomization: Allocation software was used to allocate the participants into two groups with equal numbers. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria of the study will be interviewed in the patient room by the researcher at the time of their admission to the hospital, and written and verbal consents will be obtained from the patients. Patients will then be included in the control or intervention group according to the randomization table.\n\nIntervention: For the patients in the control group, the Personal Data Collection Form and the Readiness to Discharge Scale and Knowledge test will be filled. The discharge training of the patients in the control group will be given by the health professionals responsible for their care and treatment according to their clinical routines. The patients in the intervention group, on the other hand, will be trained with the teach-back method after completing the Personal Data Collection Form, Knowledge Test, and the \"Ready to Discharge Scale\". In these trainings, \"Discharge Training Booklet\", which will be prepared by the researcher, will be used as training material. This booklet will include information about discharge after Lumbar Disc Herniation Surgery. Expert opinion will be taken for the booklet. On the day of discharge, the patients in both groups will be given the 'Ready to Discharge Scale' and the 'Discharge Training Satisfaction Scale' and Knowledge Test.\n\nData Collection Tools The data collection tools to be used in the research consist of four parts. In the first part, \"Descriptive information form\" which includes information about patients and the disease, \"Discharge Training Satisfaction Scale\" in the second part, \"Ready to Discharge Scale\" in the third part lastly there is a knowledge test prepared to evaluate the effectiveness of the discharge training given in the fourth part.\n\nDescriptive information form: This form of patients; It is a data collection tool that includes socio-demographic characteristics such as date of birth, gender, marital status, education level, and items related to the patient's disease.\n\nDischarge Training Satisfaction Scale: The scale was developed by Meşe and Köşgeroğlu in 2021. It consists of 21 items. The Cronbach α reliability coefficient for the overall scale was found to be 0.91. The scale was designed as a 5-point Likert scale. The scores that can be obtained from the scale range from 21 to 105. The scale has no cut off.\n\nScale of Readiness to Discharge: The short form (Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale/Short Form) developed by Weiss and et al. in 2014 was used. The scale consists of eight items and four dimensions, and items in the scale are evaluated on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, and higher scores indicate greater readiness.\n\nDischarge training knowledge test: In line with the literature, a knowledge test consisting of 20-25 questions will be prepared for the content of the discharge training. In this knowledge test, there will be questions containing correct and incorrect answers, and patients will be expected to tick True, False and No idea. Expert opinion will be taken about the knowledge test.\n\nStatistical analysis Collected data will analyse using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive characteristics of the participants will be presented by the frequency of the responses. Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values, will be used to present the scores obtained from the scales and the knowledge questionnaire. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to examine the suitability of the data for normal distribution. Pearson's chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test will be used to compare descriptive characteristics. If it fits the normal distribution, parametric tests will be used. If it does not fit the normal distribution, nonparametric tests will be used."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["\"discharge education\"","\"teach back metod\"","\"patients\""]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":68,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Teach Back Metod","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The patients in the intervention group, on the other hand, will be trained with the teach-back method after completing the Personal Data Collection Form, Knowledge Test, and the \"Ready to Discharge Scale\".

Compared to traditional open surgery, minimally invasive surgical technique offers muscle and bone sparing, pain reduction and faster recovery, allowing patient management in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (RAAC).\n\nSeveral minimally invasive surgical endoscopic techniques have been developed for disc herniation: Single Portal Endoscopy (SE), Video Assisted Endoscopic Discectomy, and recently Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy (UBE). SE relies on a single entry route whereas UBE is based on two entry routes : one way for optical instruments and saline irrigation system and one way for surgical instruments. Currently, SE is considered as the minimally invasive surgery gold standard for HDL treatment thanks to its advantages for controlling muscles trauma, reducing hospital stay and maintaining spinal segment stability.\n\nOver the past two years, UBE for the treatment of degenerative lumbar diseases has increased exponentially with faster learning curve than other endoscopic techniques.\n\nUBE allows a wider field of vision, wide and ergonomic operating gestures, is minimally invasive and contributes to complete nervous decompression and faster recovery. With UBE, the surgeon can use one hand to guide endoscope and he other one to guide surgical instruments . In addition, UBE generates less trauma, less bleeding, rapid recovery and good effectiveness in HDL treatment . UBE can significantly reduce postoperative nerve fibrosis, and postoperative spinal instability incidence.\n\nDuring UBE, some postoperative complications have been described as poor treatment effectiveness (nucleus pulposus nucleus residue), epidural hematoma, dural tear, nerve root injury and incomplete surgery.\n\nAs an emerging technique, further studies are needed to better understand UBE. This is why Dr. Cristini's team wish to analyze a cohort of patients for whom this technique has been used since July 2022, in particular the complication rate.\n\nControlling a new technique requires a learning phase. Chen, L et al. showed that the operation duration and the postoperative hospitalization duration, were reduced from the 24th patient until the 97th patient out of a cohort of 97 patients with lumbar disc herniation treated by UBE. However, there was no significant difference in the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) in all operated patients. This indicates that UBE still guarantees clinical effect and safety on all operated patients. This is why Dr. Cristini's team also wishes to describe the learning curve on the cohort of patients for whom UBE was used since July 2022."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Disc Herniation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy (UBE) Technique","description":"Patient with LDH treated by UBE","interventionNames":["Procedure: UBE"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"UBE","description":"Patients with HDL were treated with UBE","armGroupLabels":["Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy (UBE) Technique"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Patient complication rate","description":"Complications will include epidural hematoma, nerve root injury, neurological deficit, dural breach or tear, incomplete surgery, epileptic crisis, hypothermia.

Low Back pain life time prevalence is 65% to 80% and It is estimated that 28% experience disabling low back pain sometime during their lives.Point prevalence ranged from 12% to 33%, 1-year prevalence ranged from 22% to 65%, and lifetime prevalence ranged from 11% to 84%.Back pain peak prevalence age is 40-50, First episode of start in the 20's and recurrence rates between 39-71%. Women tend to be affected more in cervical spine problem then men and Men tend to more affected in lumbar spine problem than women. Majority (80-90%) of low back disorders occur at the L4/5 and/or L5/S1. The occupational risk factor include driving (P\\<0.001), lifting, carrying, pulling, pushing, and twisting (P\\<0.001 for all variables) as well as nondriving vibrational exposure (P\\<0.001).\n\nMaitland divides lumber spine problems into two groups, in first group the L4/5 and L5/S1 intervertebral discs are frequently a source of symptoms and second group have postural, muscles balance, muscles weakness, muscles spasm degenerative changes and mechanical movement disorders problems. The L5-S1 Segment is the most common site of problem in the spine because this level bears more weight, Center of gravity passes directly through this vertebra, transition L5 Mobile and S1 Stable, Large angle B/w L5 \\& S1 and great amount of movement.\n\nThe intervertebral disk makes up 1/3 of the total length of vertebral column. The disc contains 85% to 90% of water, but the amount decrease up to 65% with age. The water binding capacity of the disc decrease with age and degenerative changes begin to occur after 2nd decade of the life. The Facet joint carry 20-25% axial body load but this may reach 70% with degeneration of the Disc. The most significant biochemical change to occur in disc degeneration is loss of proteoglycan. This loss is responsible for a fall in the osmotic pressure of the disc matrix and therefore a loss of hydration. Loading may thus lead to inappropriate stress concentrations along the endplate or in the annulus.\n\nDecompression therapy is a result oriented approach but it expensive and minimum availability in Pakistan. In physical therapy we use different exercise to solve the multiple spine problems. Some exercise used to treat orthopedic component such as mobilization, manipulation, SNAGS, and traction. Some exercise used to treat myogenic component such as Muscle energy technique, neuromuscular reeducation, active isolated stretch etc. Some exercise used to treat neurogenic component such as Neurodynamics, Active release technique etc. As we know the fascia is important component in our body most of the time the fascia restriction make the patient condition verse. Guy Voyer introduce the systems of exercise more the 35 years ago which works specially on spine at every intervertebral level including costal and pelvic articulation. These exercises are called Elongation Longitudinaux avec Decoaption Osteo-Articulaire (ELDOA) or simply Longitudinal Osteo-Articular De-coaptation Stretching (LOADS). It can be describe as fascial stretch that's localizes tension at the level of a specific spinal segment and create decompression. In which he combined improving the tone of the intrinsic muscles of the spine along with reinforcing the extrinsic muscles related to the spine aim the back and stretching the interlinking paraspinal muscles. ELDOA exercise is design for every level of the spine from base of the skull to sacro iliac joint. In each ELDOA exercise we create fascial tension above and below the joint or disc that one is trying to \"open up\" or decompress. The outcomes include; Release vertebral compression, improved blood circulation, Disc re-hydration, improve muscle tone and awareness. One of my study also proved that ELDOA Exercises improve the pain and functional level in the spinal disc protrusion patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Decompression","Disc herniation","ODI","LBP"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"control group will recevie conventional physiotherapy sessions while the experimental group receive conventional along with decompression","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Conventional Physiotherapy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"It includes the pre-physiotherapy session by conventional physiotherapy","interventionNames":["Other: Conventional Physiotherapy"]},{"label":"Lumber spinal decompression","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"It includes the pre-physiotherapy session iby lumber spinal decompression along with conventional therapy.","interventionNames":["Other: Lumber Spinal Decompression"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Conventional Physiotherapy","description":"The treatment will be given in the following way.\n\n1.

Both session got pre and post session along with general low back exs.home plan along with precautions was guided to every patient of control and experimental group.NPRS ,ODI is assess in first and fourth session. The data will be analyzed through IBM SPSS version 21.","detailedDescription":"Low back pain due to lumber disc protrusion is common health problem in all population, which affects the normal activities of daily living by decreasing the functional status due to low back pain that rad to leg. Literature supports that decompression have significant effect in improving the functional status of patient with low back pain with radiation but reoccurrence of problem of this problem is common with this problem. So my study is aiming to find the effectiveness of ELDOA along with decompression to minimize the re occurrence of low back and functional status. ELDOA will help to tone up the fascia and strengthen the spinal muscles The intervertebral disc consists of an inner nucleus pulposus (NP) and an outer annulus fibroses (AF). The central NP area which facilitate water retention, creating hydrostatic pressure to resist axial compression of the spine. The NP is primarily composed of type II collagen, which accounts for 20% of its overall dry weight. In contrast, the AF functions to maintain the NP within the center of the disc with low amount of PG; 70% of its dry weight is comprised of primarily concentric type I collagen fibers . In LDH, narrowing of the space available for the thecal sac can be due to protrusion of disc through an intact AF, extrusion of the NP through the AF though still maintaining continuity with the disc space, or complete loss of continuity with the disc space and sequestration of a free fragment.\n\nMotorized table with mechanical space in between two parts of table. Pelvic and thoracic belt is tie at lumber and thoracic level to fasten the patient. Static, intermittent and cycling distractive force applied to lumber area for minute. Distraction(angle of pull) and relaxation force is monitored by therapist. Specific disc that cause pain and other symptoms are targeted .curves on computer help to reduce muscle spasm. Antigravity force applied on lumber area in the space and pull backward protrude disc. Biofeedback computer module in which number of session depends upon medical condition age .targeted level of spine is selected. neuro oxy spinal decompression non-surgical and cost effective Treatment that stimulate natural healing of injured and degenerative vertebra. Works on decompressing and lengthening the spine with chronic pains. These movement produce negative pressure in the disc as a result vacuum created as a result bulge, protrude part repositioned and align. Nourishment of injured area is restore by oxygen and nutrients. Pressure on nerve relives patient feel symptoms free. Special senses in machine that detect limitation and tension of patient results of spinal decompression is better than traditional traction. Other name of decompression is intervertebral differential dynamic therapy, mechanical spinal distraction therapy. Negative pressure is created between vertebras so that protruded part pull inward and nerve become free from pressure. Table has two parts which is separated with space where distractive force apply on spine. Two belts thoracic and lumber to fasten the patient. Pulling force is minimal last for a minute depend upon patient symptoms can be adjusted to static, intermittent and cycling control by therapist to induce relaxation. During treatment antigravity force applied at spine automatically by machine system and helps to move protruded part back to position as a result nerve get pressure free.

The etiology of low back pain with or without radiating leg pain is multifactorial, but it is often related to degenerative disc disease (DDD) or to spondylolisthesis. The standard treatment for symptomatic spondylolisthesis or progressive DDD in patients who are unresponsive to long-term conservative treatment is interbody fusion, but this is controversial. With some reports showing no benefit compared to conservative treatment, patient selection is vitally important. Various prognostic tests attempt to identify subsets of patients that might benefit most from surgery, but the validity of these tests is unclear. Ultimately, success in this category of patients should be defined by improved physical symptoms (patient-reported outcome measures \\[PROMs\\]) rather than technical success of the procedure. A relevant proportion of patients with intractable, conservative therapy-resistant lumbar degenerative disease do finally profit from lumbar fusion surgery - the difficult question is how to identify them securely and avoid unnecessary, unsuccessful surgery.\n\nIn the literature, several subsets of patients with lumbar degenerative disease who may profit more than others from lumbar spinal fusion have been identified. Accurate preoperative identification of patients at high risk for unsatisfactory outcome and vice-versa would be clinically advantageous, as it would allow enhanced resource preparation, better surgical decision-making, enhanced patient education and informed consent, and potentially even modification of certain risk factors for unsatisfactory outcome. However, it is often impossible for clinicians to balance the many described single risk factors for each adverse event to arrive at a personalized risk-benefit profile in individual patients.\n\nMachine learning (ML) methods have been extraordinarily effective at integrating many clinical patient variables into one holistic risk prediction tailored to each patient. One multicenter model based on classic statistics has already been described by Khor et al. - However, upon external validation, it proved to be unreliable and rather poorly calibrated. Also, this model was based on a relatively small number of patients for ML. The aim of the FUSE-ML study is to develop and externally validate a robust ML-based prediction tool based on multicenter data from a range of international centers that will provide individualized risk-benefit profiles tailored to each patient undergoing lumbar spinal fusion for degenerative disease.\n\nMethods Overview Data will be collected by a range of international centers. Overall, the models will be built and publication will be compiled according to the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines. One model will be created for each of the relevant outcomes detailed below.\n\nUniversity of Zurich (V.E. Staartjes, C. Serra) is the sponsor of this study.\n\nEthical Considerations Each center will be responsible for their own ethics board / institutional review board (IRB) approval and for establishing a data transfer agreement (DTA). The sponsor (University of Zurich) will present a standard DTA upon request. They must gain approval for retrospective or prospective data collection and sharing of the completely deidentified data with the sponsor. The sponsor can aid by providing this detailed study protocol. All study procedures will be carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.\n\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria Patients with the following indications for thoracolumbar pedicle screw placement are considered for inclusion: Degenerative pathologies (one or multiple of the following: spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease, recurrent disc herniation, failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), radiculopathy, pseudarthrosis). Patients undergoing surgery for - as the primary indication - infections, vertebral tumors, as well as traumatic and osteoporotic fractures or deformity surgery for scoliosis or kyphosis are not eligible. Patients with moderate or severe scoliosis (Coronal Cobb's \\>30 degrees / Schwab classification sagittal modifier + or ++) are not eligible. Patients undergoing surgery at more than 6 vertebral levels are also not eligible. Patients with missing endpoint data at 12 months will be excluded. Patients are required to give informed consent. Only patients aged 18 or older are considered for inclusion.\n\nData Collection Each center will collect their data either retrospectively, from a prospective registry, or from a prospective registry supplemented by retrospectively collected variables. Each center has to contribute a minimum of 100 patients with complete 12-month follow-up data to be included in the study. A standardized Excel database will be provided by the sponsor for anonymous data entry. The data will be entered in standardized and deidentified form. This Excel database will only contain a study-specific patient number. Each center will keep an internal spreadsheet in which the study-specific patient numbers can be traced back to center-specific patient-numbers, should this be necessary. The deadline for submission of the complete data to the sponsor institution is 13th of August 2021.\n\nAuthorship Centers will have to contribute at least 100 cases with complete outcome data in total to be included in the study. Each participating center will be able to designate a maximum of four authors to be included in the author list. Any other center-specific contributors will be listed as full members of the FUSE-ML study group and will be granted full PubMed / Medline contributor status. The sponsor institution will have six primary author positions available.\n\nPrimary Endpoint Definitions\n\nSeveral endpoints will be assessed:\n\n* 1. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 12 months.\n* 2. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-BP, 0 to 100) for back pain at 12 months. This can also be a converted numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0-10, or a VAS from 0 to 10 converted to 0 to 100.\n* 3. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-LP, 0 to 100) for leg pain at 12 months. This can also be a converted numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0-10, or a VAS from 0 to 10 converted to 0 to 100.\n\nThese outcomes will be dichotomized using the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) according to Ostelo et al. Thus, a 30% or greater improvement in a specific score compared to baseline will be considered as achievement of MCID (clinical success) in that specific score. If patients presented with zero symptoms initially (in either ODI, NRS-BP or NRS-LP), and remained at zero for that score, this will also be defined as MCID for that score.\n\nFeatures and Their Definitions\n\nAll features are measured or estimated preoperatively. In addition to the endpoints, the following input features will be collected:\n\n* Age (years)\n* Gender (m/f)\n* Presence of the following indications for surgery (choose all that apply):\n\n  * Spondylolisthesis\n  * (Recurrent) disc herniation\n  * Radiculopathy\n  * Chronic low back pain (CLBP) / Degenerative disc disease (DDD)\n  * Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)\n  * Lumbar spinal stenosis\n  * Pseudarthrosis\n* Index Level(s) (choose all that apply, T12 - S1)\n* Height (cm)\n* Weight (kg)\n* BMI (kg/m2)\n* Smoking status (active / ceased / never)\n* Preoperative (baseline) ODI\n* Preoperative (baseline) VAS-BP\n* Preoperative (baseline) VAS-LP\n* American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Score (1-2 / 3 or higher)\n* Preoperative use of opioid pain medication (yes / no)\n* Asthma pulmonale as a comorbidity (yes / no)\n* Prior thoracolumbar spine surgery (yes / no)\n* Race/Ethnicity (Caucasian / Black / Asian / Other)\n* Surgical approach (choose all that apply: TLIF / PLIF / ALIF / Lateral)\n* Pedicle screw insertion (yes / no)\n* Minimally invasive technique (yes / no)\n\nSample Size While even the largest cohort with millions of patients is not guaranteed to result in a robust clinical prediction model if no relevant input variables are included (\"garbage in, garbage out\" - do not expect to predict the future from age, gender, and body mass index), the relationship among predictive performance and sample size is certainly directly proportional, especially for some data-hungry ML algorithms. To ensure generalizability of the clinical prediction model, the sample size should be both representative enough of the patient population, and should take the complexity of the algorithm into account. For instance, a deep neural network - as an example of a highly complex model - will often require thousands of patients to converge, while a logistic regression model may achieve stable results with only a few hundreds of patients. In addition, the number of input variables plays a role. Roughly, it can be said that a bare minimum of 10 positive cases are required per included input variable to model the relationships. Often, erratic behavior of the models and high variance in performance among splits is observed when sample sizes are smaller than calculated with this rule of thumb. Of central importance is also the proportion of patients who experience the outcome. For very rare events, a much larger total sample size is consequentially needed. For instance, a prediction based on 10 input features for an outcome occurring in only 10% of cases would require at least 1000 patients including at least 100 who experienced the outcome, according to the above rule of thumb. In general and from personal experience, the authors do not recommend developing ML models on cohorts with less than 100 positive cases and reasonably more cases in total, regardless of the rarity of the outcome. Also, one might consider the available literature on risk factors for the outcome of interest: If epidemiological studies find only weak associations with the outcome, it is likely that one will require more patients to arrive at a model with good predictive performance, as opposed to an outcome which has several highly associated risk factors, which may be easier to predict. Larger sample sizes also allow for more generous evaluation through a larger amount of patient data dedicated to training or validation, and usually results in better calibration measures.\n\nBetween 20% and 40% of patients report no clinically relevant improvement after spinal fusion (minority class). For sample size calculation, the authors take 20% for a conservative estimate. Consequently, for this study, based on the authors' expertise and on the rules of thumb mentioned above, the authors estimate that a minimum of 200 patients with a negative outcome (minority class) are required to extract generalizable feature relationships. With an estimated incidence of approximately 20% as explained above, that means that a minimum of around 1000 patients are required for training. For adequate evaluation of calibration at external validation, the authors estimate that another 300 patients will be required (thus, approximately 60 patients with a positive outcome). Thus, in total, the authors estimate that a minimum of 1300 patients are necessary to arrive at a robust model. More data will likely lead to greater performance and better calibration.\n\nPredictive Modeling A KNN imputer will be co-trained to impute any missing data that may occur in future application of the model. If there is missing data in the training set, it will be imputed using said KNN imputer. Features or patients with a missingness greater than 25% will be excluded. Data will be standardized and one-hot-encoded. In case of major class imbalance - which is expected for the abovementioned endpoint - random upsampling or synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) will be applied to the training set. All features will initially be provided to the model for training. If necessary, the authors will apply recursive feature elimination (RFE) to select input features on the training data.\n\nThe authors will trial the following algorithms for binary classification: Generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), stochastic gradient boosting machine (GBM), naïve Bayes classifier, simple artificial neural network, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest. Each model will be fully trained and hyperparameter tuned where applicable. The final model will be selected based upon AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as calibration metrics on the resampled training performance. Training will occur in repeated 5-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats.\n\nThe one final model will then be assessed on the external validation data only once. 95% confidence intervals for external validation metrics will be derived using the bootstrap.\n\nThe threshold for binary classification will either be identified on the training data alone using the AUC-based \"closest-to-(0,1)-criterion\" or Youden's index to optimize both sensitivity and specificity, or will be optimized on the training set based on clinical significance (rule-out model). All analyses will be carried out in R Version 4.0.2 or more recent.\n\nEvaluation The performance of classification models can roughly be judged along two dimensions: Model discrimination and calibration. The term discrimination denotes the ability of a prediction model to correctly classify whether a certain patient is going to or is not going to experience a certain outcome. Thus, discrimination described the accuracy of a binary prediction - yes or no. Calibration, however, describes the degree to which a model's predicted probabilities (ranging from 0% to 100%) correspond to the actually observed incidence of the binary endpoint (true posterior). Many publications do not report calibration metrics, although these are of central importance, as a well-calibrated predicted probability (e.g. your predicted probability of experiencing a complication is 18%) is often much more valuable to clinicians - and patients! - than a binary prediction (e.g. you are likely not going to experience a complication).\n\nResampled training performance as well as performance on the external validation set will be assessed for discrimination and calibration. In terms of discrimination, the authors will evaluate AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 Score. In terms of calibration, the authors will assess the Brier score, expected-observed (E/O)-ratio, calibration slope and intercept, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, as well as visual inspection of calibration plots for both datasets, which will also be included in the publication.\n\nInterpretability The degree and choice of methods for interpretability will depend on the finally chosen algorithm. Some algorithms can natively provide explanations as to which factors influence the outcome in what way. Thus, in case e.g. a GLM, GAM, or naïve Bayes classifier is chosen, the parameters / partial dependence values will be provided. For simple decision trees, diagrams of the decision-making process can be provided. Other models with higher degrees of complexity, such as neural networks or stochastic gradient boosting machines cannot natively provide such explanations. In that case, the authors will provide both AUC-based variable importance as well as model-agnostic local interpretations of variable importance using the LIME principle.\n\nExpected Results The authors expect to arrive at a generalizable model based on multicenter international data that is likely to predict consistently with an AUC of at least 0.70 and that is well-calibrated. A web-based prediction tool will also be created for each of the two models using the shiny environment, much akin to e.g. https://neurosurgery.shinyapps.io/impairment (Also see for example: Staartjes et al., Journal of Neurosurgery, 2020). This web-based app will be available for free on any internet-capable device (mobile or desktop), and should be stable on most devices due to the server-based computing. The costs for maintaining the server will be carried by the sponsor. The collected data will be stored by the sponsor for 10 years. The large dataset will be open to further analysis and will be provided to any of the contributing centers at reasonable request and after approval by all other centers. The goal is to enable other analyses using the collected dataset. If any additional analyses lead to publication, all contributors will be included as co-authors and all co-authors will have the opportunity to review said manuscript beforehand. Any contributing study center has the right to veto publication of any subsequent analyses containing their own data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Low Back Pain","Disk Herniated Lumbar","Spinal Stenosis Lumbar"],"keywords":["machine learning","clinical prediction modeling"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1115,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Lumbar Spinal Fusion","description":"Lumbar Spinal Fusion with or without posterior stabilization"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Visual Analogue Scale for Back Pain","description":"Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Back Pain Severity from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain.","timeFrame":"12 months after surgery"},{"measure":"Visual Analogue Scale for Leg Pain","description":"Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Leg Pain Severity from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain.","timeFrame":"12 months after surgery"},{"measure":"Oswestry Disability Index","description":"Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for Subjective Functional Impairment (0 to 100, with higher values indicating higher levels of functional impairment)","timeFrame":"12 months after surgery"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* Inclusion Criteria:\n* Degenerative pathologies (one or multiple of the following: spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease, recurrent disc herniation, failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), radiculopathy, pseudarthrosis).\n* Patients are required to give informed consent.\n* Only patients aged 18 or older are considered for inclusion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients undergoing surgery for - as the primary indication - infections, vertebral tumors, as well as traumatic and osteoporotic fractures or deformity surgery for scoliosis or kyphosis are not eligible.

As it is primarily observed in the workforce, it adversely affects their quality of life. One common reason for referring a patient for surgery is radiculopathy and low back pain co-occurrence. LDH is typically observed in the adult population in active occupation. Most patients with LDH can be treated conservatively, but surgery may be necessary for around 13% of cases.\n\nThe decision to operate depends on the individual patient, but persistent radicular pain and neurological dysfunction unresponsive to conservative treatment are common indications. Minimally invasive surgical techniques are becoming more prevalent. Currently, microsurgery is the most common approach for lumbar disc herniation. In addition, endoscopic and minimally invasive surgeries have become more prevalent.\n\nLumbar microdiscectomy is a surgical procedure involving discectomy with paravertebral muscle dissection. Subsequently, patients may experience postoperative back pain, potentially impacting their quality of life. Physical rehabilitation is frequently suggested following surgery. Some studies have indicated that physical therapy and rehabilitation may not significantly improve low back pain and quality of life after lumbar disc herniation. There is yet to be an agreement on the effectiveness of physical therapy, its optimal start time, and rehabilitative methods.\n\nThis study evaluates the effects of early and late rehabilitation following unilateral microdiscectomy for lumbar disc herniation.

It received FDA approval in 2002 for HILT in the treatment of variety of musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nThere are a few studies in the literature investigating the efficacy of HILT in chronic neck pain. There is only one study investigating the efficacy of HILT in cervical disc herniation. In this study, the efficacy of HILT and ultrasound-TENS in the treatment of neck pain caused by cervical disc herniation has been compared, but the results of the exercise control group and long-term follow-up were not available.\n\nThe aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of HILT treatment using improvement in the pain, range of motion, activities of daily living and functionality of the cervical spine in patients with cervical disc herniation.

Patients were assessed in terms of disease knowledge, general self-efficacy, medical behaviour, and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). During postoperative rehabilitation, nursing staff provided health education regarding lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion.","detailedDescription":"Grouping method For the surgical treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc protrusion. The age of the included patients was greater than or equal to 18 years. Patients were cluster randomized by a coin toss into an experimental group that underwent spine surgery and a control group; 38 cases were included in each group for a total of 76 cases, and patients were assigned to the experimental and control groups in a 1:1 ratio, ensuring balance between groups. During implementation of the intervention, 1 patient in the control group voluntarily requested to withdraw from the study midway through the study, and the loss to follow-up rate was 2.6%. Finally, a total of 75 patients were included in this study, including 38 in the experimental group and 37 in the control group.\n\n3 Test group\n\n(1) Implementation of the feedback method includes information transmission, patient feedback, clarification and correction, and confirmation of understanding\n\n① Conveying health information Medical terms were transformed into plain language so that patients could easily understand the health education content. The feedback method was used to explain the pathogenesis of LDH as protrusion or degeneration of the collodium supporting the lumbar spine and rupture of the cartilage protecting the lumbar spine. The protruding collodium compresses the nerve root, leading to pain in the back and leg.\n\n* Patient feedback After a health message was delivered, the patient was asked to repeat the information back in his own words with the following question: To make sure I'm clear, could you repeat the pathogenesis for me?\n\n  ③ Educator clarification and correction If the patient had mastered the relevant information, the health education session was ended. If the patient understood some or no information, the steps were repeated, and the educator continued to explain the concept to the patient but changed the way he or she expressed it.\n\n  ④ Checking understanding Finally, open questions such as the following were used to confirm the patient's understanding: Do you have any other questions? The patients were then given a chance to sort out the health information.\n\n  (2) Patients in the test group received health education according to the feedback method, and the intervention contents and time were as follows:\n\n  ① One day before surgery: Health education team members provided bedside one-on-one education for patients, 15-20 min per session, twice a day. Health education manuals and other tools were used to explain information related to lumbar intervertebral disc herniation, including the pathogenesis of LDH, clinical manifestations, the significance of relevant examinations, the principle of surgical treatment, and the importance of exercising according to the guidance of doctors, to the patient. The main problem before LDH was pain in the waist and legs, so the patients were advised to take medication and taught how to take neurotropin, mecobalamine, Celebrex and other drugs.\n* One week after surgery: One-on-one education on rehabilitation exercise was conducted for the patients by the health education team members, 15-20 min per session, twice a day.\n\nDay of surgery: The main concerns of the patients were wound pain and axial rolling. After returning to the ward, the patients were taught about pain and the correct use of the analgesic pump.\n\nOne week after surgery: The main concerns of the patients were waist circumference and methods of rehabilitation exercise. Patients were instructed to perform straight leg raising exercises, ankle pump exercises and quad contraction exercises, 10\\~20 times/session, 3 sessions/day. If the patient understood the relevant knowledge and completed the rehabilitation exercise, the patient was affirmed and encouraged in the form of award certificates, and the \"Best Cooperation Award\", \"Best Progress Award\", \"Most Confidence Award\", \"Three Good Fellow Award\", etc., were used to enhance the patient's self-confidence, sense of honour and sense of achievement in rehabilitation exercise. In terms of discharge guidance, patients were told to go home and continue to perform functional exercise.\n\n③ Two to four weeks after surgery: The main concerns of patients were functional exercise and daily life activities. The health education group members guided the patients through functional rehabilitation exercises via WeChat. Each intervention lasted 20-30 min. The patients interacted once through WeChatB1, and their questions were answered at any time. Patients were instructed to perform head lifting training in the prone position, a wood rolling exercise, walking training (waist-assisted) and supine hip flexion and knee flexion exercises, 5-10 min/session, 3 sessions/day. Patients were required to sign in after receiving new exercises and give feedback. Patients were required to \"send a video of themselves performing functional exercise to the group\", and the health education team members corrected any incorrect movement or frequency, answered their questions, and confirmed whether they understood until they had fully mastered the correct methods for the functional exercise. WeChat pushed small pieces of information twice via a link.\n\n④ Five to 12 weeks after surgery: the main concerns of patients were functional exercise methods, such as five-point support, and other matters needing attention. The health education group members guided patients through the functional rehabilitation exercises via WeChat. Each intervention lasted 20\\~30 min, and WeChat was used for both sessions.\n\n4 Control group: The patients underwent routine health education."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Feedback method","Health education","Functional exercise"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The methods were based on previous research on the feedback method of health education.

Nonfusion system such as Wallis interspinous implants have also been successfully used in disc degenerative diseases. However, the superiority of a discectomy with Wallis in comparison to a discectomy alone for primary lumbar disc herniation has yet to be determined.The aim of our study is to investigate whether lumbar discectomy combined with the Wallis device provides better radiographic and clinical short-term outcome than posterior lumbar discectomy alone.","detailedDescription":"The most commonly used therapy for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) are partial discectomy or discectomy with fusion if there was an additional mechanical disorder in the underlying functional spinal unit. However, the problems associated with discectomy are intervertebral disc height loss and the segmental instability, thought to be a risk for failed back surgery syndrome or recurrence lumbar disc herniation. Fusion has also been criticised for its side effects of adjacent segment degeneration(ASD), pseudarthrosis and bone-graft morbidity. To prevent such complications , a new family of dynamic implants have been established. Wallis interspinous implant (Abbott Laboratories, Bordeaux, France) , invented by J. Senegas, is one of them. It consisted of a interspinous blocker made out of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) to limit extension and two dacron tapes around the spinous processes in order to secure the implant and limit flexion. The aim of using this device is to unload the facet joints, to restore foraminal height and to provide sufficient stability especially in extension but still allow motion in the treated segment. Previous clinical trials and biomechanical studies are promising, however, the superiority of a discectomy with Wallis in comparison to a discectomy alone for primary lumbar disc herniation has yet to be determined. The purpose of this prospective controlled study was to evaluate the clinical effect of lumbar discectomy combined with Wallis interspinous device, comparing with posterior lumbar discectomy alone. Our hypothesis was that the use of the Wallis device would have better clinical and radiological outcomes than lumbar discectomy alone."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Lumbar disc herniation","Wallis interspinous implants","lumbar discectomy","interspinous dynamic stability system"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":80,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"control group: Lumbar discectomy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Lumbar discectomy alone","interventionNames":["Procedure: Lumbar discectomy"]},{"label":"Treatment group: lumbar discectomy + Wallis implant","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"lumbar discectomy combined with Wallis interspinous dynamic stability system","interventionNames":["Procedure: Lumbar discectomy combined with Wallis interspinous dynamic stability system"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Lumbar discectomy","description":"All the patients were in prone positions on the operation table and received general anesthesia.

The prevalence of cervical disc herniation increases with age in both men and women. It is more common in women and accounts for more than 60% of cases. Cervical disc herniation is a spine disease that seriously affects the quality of life of patients and imposes a heavy economic burden on individuals and society. In recent years, with the widespread use of mobile phones and computers and the increase in the life pressure of today's people, the incidence of cervical disc herniation has shown a younger trend. The role of surgical and non-surgical treatment of patients with cervical disc herniation has not been adequately investigated. While the majority of published data reflects surgical outcomes, there is little data on the outcomes of patients treated without surgery. The most commonly used non-surgical treatments are manipulation, mobilization, kinesiology taping and therapeutic exercises along with electrotherapy agents such as laser therapy, TENS, vacuum interferential and traction. Exercise is considered one of the evidence-based methods to reduce pain in cervical disc herniation, prevent further injury, increase muscle strength, endurance and flexibility, improve proprioception, and contribute to and maintain normal life activities. Exercises used in neck pain in the literature consist of various exercises such as cervical isometrics, cervical concentric/eccentric exercises using pulley systems or weights, upper extremity exercises using dumbbells or deep neck flexor/extensor rehabilitation. Isometric exercises are effective in treating neck pain, range of motion and disability.","detailedDescription":"It has been reported in the literature that neck stabilization exercises should be included in the rehabilitation of patients with chronic neck pain, as they increase the strength, endurance and coordination of the spinal stabilizer muscles and therefore help in reducing neck pain and improving cervical functions. Cervical stabilization exercises are a method of exercise designed to improve the innate mechanisms that enable the cervical spine to maintain a stable, injury-free state, as in the lumbar spine. Despite the popularity of stabilization exercises, which are performed with a series of exercises that are relatively simple in terms of time and equipment, but physiologically complex, in the treatment of back and pelvic pain, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has investigated its effectiveness on neck pain, disability, strength, flexibility and quality of life in cases with cervical disc herniation. There is a deficiency.\n\nTherefore, in this study, investigators aim to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of three-week cervical stabilization exercises and cervical isometric exercises on neck pain, disability, strength, flexibility and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Cervical Disc Herniation","stabilization exercises","isometric exercises","pain"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomised Controlled Trial","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Cervical Stabilization Exercise Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"After applying traditional treatment for 40 minutes to the cases in Group A, additional segmental cervical stabilization exercises (20 minutes) will be applied.","interventionNames":["Other: segmental cervical stabilization exercises"]},{"label":"Cervical Isometric Exercise Group","type":"OTHER","description":"After applying traditional treatment for 40 minutes to the cases in Group B, additional cervical isometric exercises (20 minutes) will be applied.","interventionNames":["Other: cervical isometric exercises"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"segmental cervical stabilization exercises","description":"Segmental spine stabilization exercises were composed of axial extension, cervical extension exercises, cervico-scapulothoracic strengthening and cranio-cervical flexion exercises.","armGroupLabels":["Cervical Stabilization Exercise Group"],"otherNames":["Traditional physiotherapy treatment (40 minutes)"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"cervical isometric exercises","description":"Cervical isometric exercises consist of 6 sets in a sitting position, each movement lasting 10 seconds, each repeated 5 times, with a 5-second rest in between.","armGroupLabels":["Cervical Isometric Exercise Group"],"otherNames":["Traditional physiotherapy treatment (40 minutes)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Visual analog Scale (VAS)","description":"A visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to evaluate the patient's pain intensity.

Pain is associated with impaired cognitive function (1). Around 45-50% of these patients report cognitive deficits such as forgetfulness (23.4%), minor accidents (23.1%), difficulty finishing tasks (20.5%), and difficulty maintaining attention (18.7%) (2,3). Many studies emphasised an impairment in the cognitive tests assessing executive functioning, attention abilities, processing speed, and memory in patients with chronic pain (4,5). Studies of community-dwelling older adults found that pain, particularly widespread or severe pain, was associated with mobility Limitations in physical performance (e.g., walking speed, stair climbing, and activities of daily living) (6-9) in individuals with chronic pain and correspond to the pain level (10,11). Finally, both pain and impaired cognition affect mobility status in older adults, and mobility is affected to a greater extent when both are present (12).\n\nRecent data indicate that miR-155 has a typical multifunctional miRNA and plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes such as immunity, inflammation, cognitive dysfunction and neuropathies (13). The available experimental evidence indicating that miR-155 is up-regulated in neuropathies allows us to include this miRNA in the list of genes of paramount importance in chronic low back pain diagnosis and prognosis. Exogenous molecular control in vivo of miR-155 expression could open up new ways to restore cognitive outcome or attenuate the pain intensity (14).\n\nNo study searched the role of intervention (epidural steroid injection) on cognitive function reserve, whether it is a better substitution or not for the conservative medical treatment. Since exogenous steroid is a part of epidural injection, the systemic effect of a single dose of steroids does not affect cognitive function, giving superiority to the intervention modality on the conservative medical therapy approach (15).\n\nAim ot the work This work aims to study the impact of transforaminal epidural steroid injection in lumbar disc prolapse on pain intensity and cognitive function in relation to Micro RNA-155 serum level.","detailedDescription":"Study design and Participants:\n\nThe study will be conducted in two stages:\n\nStage (1): It will be a case control study that will include 44 patients diagnosed as having symptomatic lumbar disc prolapse and 44 age and sex matched healthy controls. Both patients and control groups will be subjected to measurement of baseline miR-155 expression level.\n\nStage (2): It will be an interventional non-experimental study that will include only the 44 patients who had symptomatic lumbar disc prolapse. Those patients will be subjected to transforaminal epidural steroid injection. Assessment of pain intensity, functional disability, cognitive function, depression, and miR-155 expression level will be done for the included patients before and 1 month after transforaminal epidural steroid injection to clarify the effect steroid injection on these variables.\n\nThe included patients will be recruited from the neurology and pain clinics of Beni-Suef University Hospital, in the period from December 2022 to September 2023.\n\nThe study will include patients with clinical evidence of disc bulge in the form of disc related radicular pain of \\>3 months duration, not responding to conservative treatment and interfering with daily activities. The selected patients should have radiological evidence of posterolateral lumbar disc bulge by MRI lumbosacral.\n\nData collection History will be taken from the selected patients regarding the demographics and the duration of lumbar disc related radicular pain. The imaging findings regarding the number of prolapsed discs and the degree of the most prolapsed disc will be also obtained.\n\nAssessment of pain intensity and functional disability Assessment of the pain intensity and functional disability will be done before and 1 month after the interventional pain management procedure. Assessment will be done using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).\n\nCognitive assessment Cognitive assessment will be done before and 1 month after the interventional pain management procedure. Assessment will be done using Paired Associate Learning test (PALT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT).\n\nInterventional pain Procedure:\n\nThe selected patients will be brought to the preparation room where reassurance will be done. Intravenous midazolam 0.2 mg/kg will be given to them, then they will be placed in the prone position on fluoroscopy table and draped in a sterile manner. They will be connected to a monitor (SPO2, NIBLP, and ECG) and given supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula (3 L/min) to maintain the oxygen saturation. A 22-gauge, 3.5-inch spinal needle will be used in the injection procedure. With each insertion of the spinal needle, 1 ml with 20 mg of local anesthetic lidocaine 2% will be injected intradermally.\n\nThe patients will be given transforaminal epidural injection of steroids with local anesthetic (7 mg Betamethasone preceded by a test dose of 1 milliliter 2% lidocaine).\n\nLaboratory assessment Estimation of miR-155 expression level: Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected from the patients (before and 1 month after the interventional procedure) and controls. The samples will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and plasma and/ or serum will be stored at -80 C till analysis. Total RNA will be extracted. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be performed. miR-155 expression level will be calculated by the difference in threshold cycle method."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Disc Herniation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":88,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"lumbar disc prolapse group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"44 patients diagnosed as having symptomatic lumbar disc prolapse","interventionNames":["Drug: transforaminal epidural injection.","Other: micro RNA-155 serum level"]},{"label":"Control","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"44 age and sex matched healthy controls","interventionNames":["Other: micro RNA-155 serum level"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"transforaminal epidural injection.","description":"transforaminal epidural steroid injection.","armGroupLabels":["lumbar disc prolapse group"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"micro RNA-155 serum level","description":"Estimation of miR-155 expression level:","armGroupLabels":["Control","lumbar disc prolapse group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Assessment of pain intensity","description":"Change in Numeric Rating Scale following transforaminal epidural steroid injection: It is an 11-point numeric scale for pain intensity evaluation, ranging from 0 to 10, where higher scores denote more intense pain.","timeFrame":"1 month"},{"measure":"Assessment of functional disability","description":"Change in Oswestry Disability Index following transforaminal epidural steroid injection: It consists of ten questions, scored on a scale of 0-5 for each, where higher scores denote more limitations.

Unilateral lumbar disc herniation is characterized by compression or irritation of the lumbar nerve roots or dural sac by either protrusion, extrusion or sequestration of the nucleus pulposus, mostly in the posterolateral region. Compression or irritation of the lumbar nerve roots and dural sac can induce unilateral sensory and motor symptoms. Therefore, it is the principal cause of lumbar spinal surgery.\n\nDifferent imaging studies have investigated asymmetry of the paraspinal muscles in patient with unilateral low back pain due to lumbar discus herniation. Both animal and human studies indicate a reduction in total muscle cross-sectional area, increased fat infiltration and fibrosis within the lumbar multifidus at the affected side.\n\nIncreased fat infiltration is clinically important because there is a correlation between the amount of intramuscular fat and lumbar muscle dysfunction. Not only fat infiltration correlates with lumbar dysfunction, also a lower multifidus cross-sectional area is associated with and predictive for low back pain. This indicates that there is an association between paraspinal muscle changes/ remodeling and muscle dysfunction that could lead to low back pain.\n\nThe aim of this research is to quantify the decrease in muscle and muscle fibre size, the amount of fat infiltration, and the amount of fibrosis present within the multifidus muscle at the herniated side in relation to the unaffected side.

Within the vast differential of LBP, the most common source is intervertebral degeneration leading to degenerative disc disease and LDH. The efficacy of manipulative physical therapy, physical therapy intervention and therapy by general practitioner (GP) for persistent general LBP and neck pain was investigated on 256 patients how didn't received any of the above therapy in last two years were contained in this study. Physical therapy included workout exercises, massage, and physical therapy (related to hot pack, different pain modalities like therapeutic ultrasound, shortwave diathermy, and electrotherapy). Manual therapy includes manual reduction by manipulation and mobilization of the back. Interventions received by GP is medicine related (different types of pain killer and muscles relaxant), guidance about the posture, home plan exercises and different healthy activities and proper rest. Placebo intervention included adjustable shortwave diathermy session for (10 minutes), and adjusted therapeutic ultrasound session for (10 minutes). Recovery rate in the leading complaint was increased with the group receiving manual therapy intervention (4.5) as compare to physical therapy (3.8), after a detailed one year of continuous therapy. There is a great progression seen in physical work by manual therapy. Moreover, manipulation is get going improved gradually, as compare to physiotherapy following in period of 12 months.\n\nThe first meta-analysis estimated the efficacy of SMT for LBP due to LDH with other therapies come to the result that SMT was equally effective when compare to other traditional therapies. However a past systematic review was come to the conclusion that SMT was secure and effective in relation to its costs for managing SLDD like LDH, that conclusion was quoted to promote by a very few publications.\n\nOne of the present research studies after one year of continuation showed decrease in pain and increase in recreational activities to a long period of time, an additional research work in 2016 described, a remarkable progression in sciatica after 30 days, in patients with lumber discs extrusion and sequestration, as a result of HVLA thrust.\n\nIn spite of the factor that there is only average numbers of documentation in the written work which promoted the utilization of SMT to manage LDH, it is extensively applied by therapist.\n\nthe comparison of cyriax manipulation and decompresion is an important adding to the researches in evidence based practices. there is no such work done before on comparison of both intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lumbar Disc Herniation"],"keywords":["Herniation","Cyriax manipulation","decompression","bulge","protruded","extruded"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"cyriax manipulation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"cyriax manipulation have three types of classes, rotation, extension and anti-deviation, which is further divided into subclasses.

The objective of this clinical study is to provide basis for a confirmatory study design (endpoints, methodologies) (Phase II), and to develop a safety profile (Phase I). This study further aims at developing and validating known and new biologic markers for the quality and clinical efficacy of the product as requested in the context of identity, purity and potency characteristics of the medicinal/investigational product.","detailedDescription":"This is a classical Phase II study with an implicated Phase I part. The Phase I/II combination study is a non-confirmatory study aimed at gathering preliminary clinical information on NOVOCART® Disc plus used in a new indication in the repair of a herniated disc. It will be conducted in a prospective, multicenter, unmasked, clinical trial including 120 subjects randomized to NOVOCART® Disc plus (NDplus, 60 subjects), media NOVOCART® Disc basic with no active cell component (NDbasic, 36 subjects) and to standard of care (SC) sequestrectomy as control (24 subjects). 24 patients will be enrolled in Phase I of the study (12 NDplus, 12 NDbasic) and 96 patients in Phase II (48 NDplus, 24 NDbasic, 24 SC).\n\nAll subjects will be evaluated at 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-months post-t0 examination in the SC study arm and 1.5-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-months post-t5 examination in the NDplus and NDbasic study arms, and then 5 years post-t0/t5 to collect long-term clinical data. Efficacy measurements for functional improvement will be evaluated among NDplus, NDbasic and SC. Physiological effects observed from MRI measurements will be compared between appropriate treatments depending on expected treatment mechanisms. Safety data of NDplus will be combined with NDbasic to contrast against SC on procedure related risks and NDplus against NDbasic and SC together on graft-related adverse experiences.\n\nTo optimize the usefulness of clinical information, data collected in the study may be analyzed and reviewed continuously. Early findings may be used to modify the study design when deemed appropriate and acceptable by the Sponsor's medical advisors. Data-driven adaptive actions include but are not limited to stopping enrollment early. The Sponsor will inform regulatory bodies, Ethic Committees, and investigators before implementing study design modifications.\n\nCells and tissues collected from this study will be used in other in vitro-controlled experiments aimed at developing and validating known and novel biologic markers to quantify cell quality in the context of identity, purity and potency. Prognostic values of these biologic markers will be examined by correlating them with clinical data collected in this study.\n\nThe study will follow each subject for a total of five years post-t0 examination in the SC study arm and post-t5 examination in the NDplus and NDbasic study arms to obtain long-term performance data.\n\nPatients must have a single-level acute disc herniation with an indication for an elective sequestrectomy. They may further have corresponding disc degeneration in the proximal adjacent segment (Pfirrmann Score Stage 3-4). A total of 120 adults will be enrolled in this study.\n\nEach patient will remain in the study for 5 years post t0/t5 examination to complete the planned follow-up phase. It is expected to take 6 years and five months to collect all required data for this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Intervertebral Disc Displacement","Intervertebral Disc

After obtaining informed consent, subjects were evaluated during a screening period of no more than 3 weeks (21 days). This study was conducted in 10 centers in the US.\n\nSubjects that met all screening requirements and inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. Overall, 24 subjects were enrolled and treated: 6 subjects in each cohort. Cohort 1 received a 5 μg/disc dose of KTP-001 by intradiscal injection. Following administration of study drug, subjects were confined to the study center for 24 hours to collect data for safety and efficacy measures and collect blood samples for safety, PK evaluation, exploratory PD and anti-KTP-001 antibody and then returned for further assessments at various intervals from weeks 1 through to month 24.\n\nAfter all subjects in Cohort 1 had received study drug, safety measures were evaluated by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to determine whether to escalate KTP-001 administration to the next dose level. If appropriate, Cohort 2 subjects received 15 μg/disc of KTP-001, Cohort 3 subjects received 50 μg/disc of KTP-001, and Cohort 4 subjects received 150 μg/disc of KTP-001 by intradiscal injection.
